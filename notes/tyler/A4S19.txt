Middle of the night, Wealday - Hidden lair beneath Bain manor
	Mechanical whirring and clicking coming from the room Alistair just got shot from
	Also distant sounds from upstairs
	INITIATIVE
		Krug moves over to Alistair, LoHs him, and then asks Alistair what happened
		The contraption reloads, and we hear the sound of moving stone
		Iris moves to the doorway, holds out her mirror to safely look into the contraption's room, then explains what she saw to the others
			Vials from the top of a table are being loaded into the contraction
			Hourglass on the table that appears to manage the cycling of the contraption
			Bowl in the center of the table is depressed, and appears to hold the fuel for the contraption
			The contraption's a big fucking gun
			Gargoyles on either side of the room, looking toward the doorway
		Tetron shuffles to get a better angle, then launches a book through the doorway with telekinetic projectile in an attempt to trigger the contraption
		Viola deftly tumbles her way past the contraption and aims it into a random corner
	Viola sees all the fun chemicals and documentation on the table and calls Alistair and Tetron over
	Alistair immediately attempts to disarm the contraption
		He sets it off instead
	Alistair notices that Viola smells like charcoal
		She turns around for the others to inspect: nothing visible
	Alistair sets it off again
	Tetron starts to look at the magical runes that control it
		He isn't able to pull the magic apart
	Alistair gets it on the third try
	Tetron inspects the runes further
		Some family history has been encoded into the magic
		The fuel is Kyphon's blood
	The smell about Viola is growing stronger
		Tetron considers it
		The magic runes give a hint: Viola's hands are petrifying into smoldering charcoal inside her gloves
			Tetron happens to have brought along a scroll of remove curse
				Iris snatches it and casts the spell
					It works
	Alistair starts rummaging
		No traps at the table; the whole room was trapped after all
		While Alistair works, Iris can now hear the faint sounds of conversation of the guards
			They haven't yet figured out that the basement was entered
				Viola takes the time to close and lock the doors out of the dragon's room
		Viola shoves as much of the papers into her bag as possible
		He also finds a large, blood-red box
			Some of the text on the exterior has been partially scratched out
			Also covered in blood
			Some kind of complex chart of numbers covers the lid
			Tetron takes a look at the text
				It's infernal!
				"The blood settles, the crowning of our country's new legacy."
				"A howling wind, a gale erupts this year to shape the world."
				[damaged]"The [something]ies, a [damaged]ake the heavens."
			Seems like several people have died investigating this puzzle
			Tetron wants to reallocate to read the damaged text
				We don't necessarily have the time...
				Let's take the box along
	Let's go check out the secret door
		Alistair finds it trapped
			Takes him a few tries to disarm it
			It was poison and corrosive gas
		And then inside he finds another trap under the rug
			Which he wouldn't have set off due to it being a pressure plate
			Acid darts disabled
		Treasure!
			Racks of weapons and armor
				Mostly mundane, but...
				We shove everything magic into a bag to sort later
			Two large glass containers holding an empty cracked egg and one whole egg
				The intact egg is covered in mucus, the occupant moves and shifts the soft shell
					Should we take it?
						Keep it as a pet!
						Viola: Give it to someone knowledgeable, like Tetron's friend
						Tetron is able to determine that the egg isn't likely to hatch for a week and a half
						Into the bag!
			We hear the guards notice that the dragon thing died
		We make our exit as the guards start to investigate the basement
			Tetron puts up an illusory object to hide the tunnel entrance
			The tunnel is walkable for a ways before it starts to curve up and down
				We figure out what the deal is when we hear the sounds of the tide - it's to keep the water out
				We emerge at the shore of Star Bay - THE ANDORAN SIDE
					We're at the bottom of a cliff
					We're outside the city
					Alistair and Krug climb up the cliff to set up a rope
	Back into Cassomir
		It's almost two in the morning when we get back
		Viola has to remind Tetron that he has Sending before he sends mail to Cyrus about the egg
		To the Black Pit Tavern
			The woman prestidigitates our clothes on the way in
			She also mentions that breakfast will be cinnamon rolls
			Borgon makes fun of us as we return
				Tetron tells him about the egg
					Borgon is horrified
					What is the other half?
						Viola: could hold it up to a light to see like regular eggs
						Alistair takes a look, and there's more than two halves, and it'll be sapient
							And it's a girl
							ETHICAL DEBATE
								Eventually agree on not killing it, but where to put it
									Best options... Almas or Isle of Arenway?
										Tetron knowledge of druids
											Political experience
											Achak Quercus - archdruid of lichen, probably most knowledgeable about fleshwarp
											Eno-Nez Tsio - archdruid of surf, listens to call of nature, likely deciding vote
											Brioni Urtlay - archdruid of the bough, very new member of the council, traditionally trained, believes in goodness of people, spearheaded peace talks with Eutropia
			Finally time for sleeps

	Taking a look at the cursed map from the Bains'
		It marks a location near Dunholme
		Marked in the Pellsieve
		Original map burned
	While Tetron and Alistair sort through loot, the rest of us go through docs
		80% is notes detailing the development of Kyphon and prior failed attempts
		10% are various financial records
			Towards the end, we find transactions with the Kaulfields and someone at Greyguard Castle
		And now the good stuff...
			Notes detailing their servants working on the box
				The box was given by the Kaulfields for safe keeping
			The Bains REALLY want the contents
				Leverage over the Kaulfields
				The box may contain information about their whereabouts
			Transactions between Bains and Kaulfields detailed
				Supplies for the egg
			Dossier about an individual they're tracking
				Dangerous for the Bains
				Haven't found them yet
				Male half-elf human named Dominic Eiredor
					Has been poking into the Bains for some time
					Fight with a sword-cane
					Killed Bains' informants
		Tetron wants to omit info of the box from what we hand over to Margot
Over to House Vaylen
	Plenty of milling about
		Journalists interviewing Lady Vaylen about last night
	We don't see Margot immediately
	A servant stops us
		Place is closed for press stuff
		Viola: We're here for Margot about last night
			Wha?
		Iris: We meant now
			Lady Vaylen eyes us and decides to let us in
	Brought to Margot
		Viola: Mission accomplished!
			And dumps the documents then summarizes
		Margot asks whether we found anything dangerous
			Krug admits finding the box
				Margot knew about it?
					She had a tip
					Viola: Eiredor?
						Yes, they're in the documentation
							Oof
		She'll pass stuff along, we'll be paid in due time
		Tetron warns her about the op-sec slip with Lady Vaylen
At the "purple" flower field
	Looks worse than we left it
		Many of the birds' feathers are dull and are low-energy
		Some are even dead
		Big magic bird is gone
		Plant life is fine, though
To the Heartwood!
	We discuss our approach
	Tetron advises that we go to the shop to ask for directions
		We're greeted warmly by the yak guy
			Viola asks for directions to folks in charge
				Iris: Druids, of the arch variety
			Dude brings us over to the Palmweald Gate, the entrance to the Hundred Sun Pine
	At the gate
		Viola deferentially explains the gist of the situation
		We're told to wait for the archdruids to decide whether to convene
		We're allowed in, but we have to leave our gear
			Everyone's cool about it
		We go into the Hundred Sun Pine
	Inside the pine
		We come upon three individuals
			One is the second-most ancient-looking dude ever, and he's horrified by the egg
			The second is dripping wet and has barnacles stuck to him
			The third is younger and dressed in green
		The woman speaks, greeting us and inviting us to explain as thoroughly as possible
			Viola, Iris, and Tetron, give testimony
			The wet one asks Alistair to chime in
			Feedback
				Wet one says that healing the fleshwarping is beyond them
					He thanks us for bringing the matter to them
					Grave matter to be discussed with care
				"Well sung"
