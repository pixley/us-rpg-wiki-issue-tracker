A4S7
----

Sunday, before bed
	Alistair considers the route from Almas to Cassomir
		Souston and Triela are technically along the way, but you have to go more out of the way
		Most transit is done via ship
		Overland transit is really only done when absolutely necessary
		Terrain
			No woods, though scattered clusters of trees do exist
			Hills and craggy bits
			Mostly plains, but those are the safe parts
		Interesting features along the way?
			No shipwrecks, because the Andoren gov't cleans shit up
			Pass through Giant's Tooth, which was the site of a historical battle
				But it's a good spot for an ambush
	Discussion of route
		Direct route is 10 days
			Tetron, Alistair, and Viola seem disinterested in the towns
			Alistair is interested in Giant's Tooth
			Krug doesn't seem to care
	Tetron finishes his reproduction of Margot Macera
	Alistair buys a wand of invisibility
Bedtime
	Iris has a dream, but Spencer isn't here
Moonday morning
	Krug, Alistair, and Viola chip in to get a wagon
		Tetron preps three phantom steeds: one for him to ride, two to pull the wagon
	To the Macera house!
		Wimberly meets us out front with Margot
			Mother warns us that her daughter gets carsick
		The caravan is three wagons: the cargo, the wagon for Margot, and a wagon for us
	We head out!
		Margot's wagon is swanky
			She'll be reading a book, it seems
			There's a second woman, riding shotgun
				Her name is Kadiha, Margot's maid-servant
		Travel order
			Us, Margot, Cargo
			Krug drives
Travel
	Moonday
		Uneventful most of the day, but in the afternoon, it starts to look like it may rain in the coming days, but not today
		We pass groups of merchants along the way
			One asks us whether we're taking the direct route to Taldor
				He asks us to keep an eye out for his buddy, who's a toy merchant based out of Cassomir
		Stopping for the night
			Margot hasn't gotten sick today
			Tetron checks in on Margot
				Tetron can tell that she doesn't actually have that much of an issue with nausea, and can tell that he's underestimating her
		Watch setup
			Tetron/Viola, Krug/Alistair, Iris/Kadiha
		First watch
			Both of us notice the incoming fog to be abnormal
				It's cooling and the fog isn't settling
				Tetron figures that there's some magical influence here
					But he can't detect a source in the area
					It occurs to Tetron that Selma's journal might suggest something
						Mention of sending messages via thunderstorms
							Huh
			Tetron mentions that he doesn't trust Margot
				Viola agrees
				Tetron wants to dig into her
				Viola isn't confident about prying
					Given Margot's role as a spy
					Compartimentalization of her dual lives
				Viola also finds it almost hypocritical
				Tetron wants her to think on it anyway
					Viola does agree that things are sus
		Second watch
			Thunder starts to rumble in the distance
			Krug also notices the weird fog
				Additionally, the sounds of the night are muffled slightly
				Alistair volunteers to move farther away to see if anything's up
					He goes out to a nearby hill and uses his spyglass
						Definitely doesn't make sense, given the geography
						He can tell that the dampening isn't happening over here
						Also, the thunderstorms in the distance aren't following normal weather patters
					He reports back
						Krug suggests that the cargo might be the source of the muffling
							Alistair starts circling the camp trying to see whether that is the case
								Takes quite a while
								The cargo is causing the muffling
									100-foot radius
									He goes up to it to see if he can hear the sucking sound mentioned before
										No
									The effect doesn't seem to scale with distance
		Third watch
			None of us are awake for that
	Toilday
		Daily prep
			Fog has thickened, but not impassable
		Alistair spots a flicker of movement, quite a ways off the road
			It's moving parallel to us
				It's faster than us
			It appears to be a large creature
			He alerts us
				Tetron casts hallucinate, making it unable to percieve us
		Later in the day, Alistair spots an overturned wagon off the road
			He asks us to stop
				Tetron, Viola, and Alistair go investigate
					Overturned crates, smaller clothes, toys
						Alistair notices that these are goods bound for Tamuth House
					Viola suggests that we need to find a body
						Tetron spots a trail of blood droplets
					We follow the trail
						We come upon a crumpled-over man
							Dude has a serious head wound and is loosely holding a small doll
							Alistair checks to see if dude is still alive
								Barely
								Also, the wound was pressed in back-to-front
							Tetron uses his staff of healing
						The man wakes up
							He asks if we're adventurers
								Yup, good thing we spotted the cart
							Something spooked his horse
								But he can't, in good conscience, dump this on someone else
									Tetron insists that we can help
										He thinks that the doll he's holding cursed him
											It won't leave him, unless he gives it willingly to someone else
											Tetron: how did this start?
												He and his wife tried to start a family
												He got the doll as a gift on the day his son was born
												Inexplicably, he feel like he's had more anxiety since it came into his life
													Terrible feeling of lonliness
													Alleviated a bit when given to his kid
												When the kid tugged at the doll's arm, the kid's own shoulder moved unnaturally
									Tetron suggests that dude go to Almas U to get decursed
										He writes a note to allow the dude in and to bill Tetron for the spell
							We head back over to the wagon, it's totalled
								Tetron volunteers a phantom steed spell to get him most of the way back to Almas
		Fog thickens as the day goes on
		Make camp
			Tetron checks on Taranis
				All good
			Viola suggests that we find a way to decurse now that Nilbog is gone
		First Watch
			Neither sees anything, but Tetron inexplicably feels wet on his back
				He asks Viola to look
					Looks dry
				He asks Viola to feel
					She removes her glove, sticks her hand down the back of his collar
						It is wet
						It smells like grass
				Tetron suggests that he head back
					Viola doesn't want him to travel alone
					What about Taranis?
						Tetron doesn't like it, but it's not a bad idea
							Tetron instructs Taranis to track down dude and make sure he gets to Almas U
		Second Watch
			The two watches swap info
				Tetron asks for more testing for the dampening effect
			Nothing of note
		Third Watch
			Iris finds the doll laying on the ground
			Iris wakes folks up, saying "I think someone's here to talk to you"
				Alistair and Krug wake up
			A massive fog-being descends upon us
				Iris: It's punishment day
					It's the day of power, and you're gonna get rekt
					She's not participating in this shit
				YOU WHO HAVE IMPRISONED MY ONLY CHILD, YOU WHO HAVE TURNED YOUR BACK ON AN OATH
					Alistair and Krug say they don't know what it's talking about
					It explains again, and Krug is all like "...Tessra?"
				Alistair wakes up Viola
					"I think Tessra's dad is mad at us"
				Viola: Hi, I'm happy to talk about this, but we need a bit to wake up
INITIATVE
	Order: Storm, Alistair, Viola, Krug, Tetron
	Round 1
		Storm guy drops fucking lightning on us, but only Krug takes damage, then he thickens the fog
		Alistair casts ray of frost at cloudman, which hits, then he moves away
			The ray of frost impact seems to have thinned the fog
		Viola tries to bug cloudman, but he ignores all three of her quips
		Krug notices that dude's effectiveness ebb and flow with the thickness of the fog, then picks up a rock and throws it, hitting dude
		Tetron tries to appeal to cloudman by pointing out that he's fighting Tessra's battle for her, but dude answered Tessra's prayers, then casts cone of cold with reach
			Fog drops considerably
		Iris fails to intimidate cloudman, then backs away
	Round 2
		Cloud man drops another lightning on us, Viola takes no damage, Tetron and Krug take half, then douses the campfire, removing light
		Alistair blindly casts ray of frost into the air, then hides behind a tree
		Viola sarcastically comments on the fire going out but is ignored again, then heaves her throwing knife into the air twice, both to no effect
		Krug calls out cloudman's weakening power, frightening him, then throws another rock, hitting
		Tetron casts cone of cold again
			The fog disappates as it seems like dude left
Back to watch
	Iris hands the doll to Tetron
More travel
	Wealday
		Kadiha tells Margot about the storm, but not the guy
		We enter a small wood
		We see a dude hunting a boar
			Tetron calls out to him
				Asks if dude has seen anything interesting
					He heard a shattering sound last night in the direction we're going
						Small
		Setting up for the night
			We hear multiple shatterings in the distance
				Tetron can tell that Margot is feigning disinterest, but she is curious
				Alistair climbs a tree and pulls out his spyglass
					He sees a camp with a fire and tents
						The fire changes color, changing to blue and green on occasion
				Alistair reports to Tetron
					Tetron figures out that someone is goofing around with alchemical materials in a fire
					Krug and Viola are concerned about a forest fire
			Leaving Kadiha to hold the fort
		Investigating the alchemy fire
			Alistair scouts ahead
				Wooden barricades surrounding the camp
				Raggidy tents
				Four medium humanoids
					One of which has curved horns and a black beard
				Horned man drinks half a bottle, throws it in the fire, then continues his speech
					Talking about starting a guild in Almas, to fill a vacuum
					Dude's name is Urimir the Scorned
						Alistair hasn't heard the name
			Alistair reports back
			Tetron hails the group
				Having trouble with a brew?
					No, they just stole this shit
				Tetron notices a mesh-covered pit
					Inside is Mosely Pose
				Tetron warns dude about drinking Mosely Pose's shit
					Viola laughs her ass off
					Dude: These are potions of power
					No, it's waterbreathing
				Dude demands Tetron leave
					Fine, whatever, Tetron turns around
					Alistair shoots dude
