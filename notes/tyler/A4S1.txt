Moonday evening
	We've rested and recovered
	Various goings-on in the intervening time
		Zaknos and Nilbog still aren't back
		Fallout from our attack on Timberfell
			Extreme scrutiny
			Gavel Tarsus is trying to negotiate with the government
				She wants the government to help
				The government wants Timberfell back
		Vote of no-confidence against Supreme Elect Andira Marusek
			Her handling of the Darkmoon incident has been deemed unsatisfactory
				Prioritizing people over the lumber
		Trial in The Half has concluded
		For the sake of public safety and peace, many details of our activities below the city are being kept quiet
			We've talked to the authorities
			Aegis Coalition has been sanctioned
			Sloane is nowhere to be found
	Knock at Viola and Krug's door
		Viola answers
		It's the Olgirs
		Amos is concerned about Zaknos
		Viola explains how Zaknos and Nilbog vanished
			So we don't know where they are either
		Amos is even more concerned
			He asks what he can do to help
				Viola warns against him contributing - leave it to us
		The Olgirs depart and join a separate caravan
	So, what to do now
		Tetron heads to the university to research teleportation magic or ways to find people
			Contact Friends ritual
				It's 3rd level, which means that we are powerful enough to cast it
				It's uncommon, but there are definitely professors who would know
				50 gp for incense
				15 gp for someone to cast it
					But Tetron can learn it
						He goes to Professor Lebrum
							He explains the situation with Zaknos's disappearance
							He's taught the ritual
							The professor even has half of the incense required and he gives it
		Alistair suggests maybe communing with Sarenrae
			Viola has a better idea: Alseta knows about teleportation!
				She goes to Krug and explains that, in addition to the teleportation stuff, she also wanted to sort out some kind of "help me help you" kind of arrangement
					The Everflowing Cavern would probably be a good place for that
		At the Velour Grotto
			The place is busy, given how fucky things have been lately
				Gordon greets us
				Viola asks for access to the Everflowing Cavern
					Gordon brings us in
			Krug leads things off
				He finds a calm place to sit and instructs Viola to sit in a way that doesn't occupy her mind
				Krug explains that, when he's trying to contact Sarenrae, that he envisions what she is for him
					The warmth of the sun, forgiveness, etc
			Viola settles in, removing her boots
				She builds this mental image of Alseta peering out from a doorway made of natural materials
				Her other senses heighten
				As she holds this vision, she gives her statement: I'm Viola, member of the Radiant Dawn, and we're trying to help against the Aegis Coalition; to benefit both of us, I request your aid
				Viola envisions a liminal space with a glowing sphere
					Peering inside, she finds herself in a hallway with red and gold carpets
						She can only see; no other senses
						Nilbog is walking alongside
						Once they reach the top of a staircase, they're greeted by a hulking man with cauliflower ear
						They're brought onto a balcony, where they see a guy who looks like an old, haggard Zaknos, who gives the POV person an awkward hug
						Vision terminates
				Viola's back in the Everflowing Cavern, with a blue flower bud in her open palm
					Krug asks how it went
					Viola says she saw Zaknos and Nilbog
						Saw what might be Zaknos's dad?
						Don't know where they specifically are, though
						OOC Note: Only Zaknos and Nilbog know that Zaknos's family are in Galt
		Alistair changes into his street clothes and heads to Timberfell
			Acts like a random child whose friend is missing
				Asking for Mateo
			Alistair is directed straight into the Clutch's little area
				Folks are running around trying to contribute to the recovery
				Mateo notices Alistair and gives the briefest expression of shock
					Alistair sits down next to him
						"Are you okay?"
						Mateo says that he's made a mistake, but he's not allowed to leave
						They're threatening him if he tries to return to the Greencloaks
							Who's doing the threatening?
								Mostly Daniel, sometimes Eric
							Don't like it here
							Alistair asks where he stay at night, because we can help
								Don't have to return to the Greencloaks - Alistair took up adventuring
									Mateo is interested
								Alistair recounts how he ended up with the group in Falcon's Hollow after Dorfinn got arrested
									It's fun and helps people
									Not having to worry about the limitations of the thief profession
							Mateo tells him where he's staying - some barracks in the back
							Some folks tried to rescue him before, they got hurt
							Alistair asks whether anyone else wants out
								No
							Alistair: don't draw attention to yourself in the meantime
							Mateo: How can I signal if something comes up?
								Alistair assures him that we're skilled enough to
					Mateo suddenly shoves Alistair behind a large sack of grain and pulls out a whittling knife
						After a moment, footsteps approach
						Voice asks what he's doing
							Mateo: Just whittling, staying out of the way
							Warns him to not do anything to make the Clutch look bad
								WILL beat him without Eric around
						After a bit, Mateo indicates that it's safe to come out again
							Alistair tells him that we'll come tonight
	Reconvene at the inn, it's night now
		Tetron tells us about the ritual
			Viola mentions her vision
			Need two people: magic expertise and tracking expertise
			Is this a good time?
				Alistair says that he needs the rest of our help to rescue his friend
					Tetron nearly scolds him for going to Timberfell, but he and Viola are proud of him for asking us for help
						Also, things were super chaotic there
					How do we get in?
						Sneak in through sewers, probably
						How do we move around without be recognized?
							We have Invisibility, Alistair's hat of disguise, and Viola's acting
					Alistair suggests that he go get the Greencloaks
						Yeah, do it
							Meet at the hole we made in the sewers to go to the temple
								Good landmark in a neutral location
								Avoids the bridges
							He runs off
					Tetron does spell reconfig
						Invisibility...
							Viola: I can act, Tetron and Krug can be invisible
								Tetron: Invisible Krug still makes noise
								Viola: Right, maybe hold Krug in reserve until things go loud
									Actually, if Alistair and the Greencloaks take point, why would any of us need to be invisible if we jump in for fighting?
									Viola: Oh!  Keep Invisibility to help Alistair's friend escape
	Alistair meets with Greencloaks
		They're on board
		Two adults available
			Alistair asks for Cara and Belladonna to come along
				The latter for healing
		He leads them to the meeting point
In the sewers
	They aren't blocked off
		Good sign in terms of people being sus of us
	Timberfell is still abuzz, despite it being late
		Injuries still being tended to
		Increased guard activity
	The sewer exit we used last time is closest to the barracks where Mateo is
	We meet Cara (who we've seen before) and Belladonna (who we're meeting for the first time)
	Options
		Between here and the barracks, there used to be buildings
			They burned down
			Cara suggests exiting farther away for better cover along the way
				Belladonna: someone should stay here so that quick escape is covered
					Viola: Yeah, the rest of us were planning on hanging tight in case things went loud
					Tetron: I'll be messaging Alistair periodically
	Alistair and Cara head around back, others stay at "open" sewer exit
	Tetron entrusts Taranis to Alistair
		Taranis can scout to keep an eye out
	Action time!
		Alistair and Cara sneak out from the farther exit
			They creep along for a ways
			Alistair gets distracted by his thoughts and nearly falls into a hole that had been boarded over
				Cara grabs him before he falls in
				The noise alerts a couple of guards, but they evade them for the time being
			They arrive at a squat three-story building
				Up on the third story, there is an open window with a lit candle on the sill
				Alistair asks Taranis to go take a look
					He circles around for a moment before landing on the sill
					Two dark hands grab the sill and Mateo looks out the window and doesn't see Alistair and Cara, but he starts to make his way out anyway
		Shouting comes from Mateo's window
			"Where do you think you're going?!"
			Mateo tries to explain that he wanted to use the bathroom
			The voice doesn't buy it
		Cara asks Alistair if Taranis can help
			Nope, just scouting
		A female voice tries to reason with the first voice
			Alistair recognizes her as Frey
			Shot down immediately
			"Please calm down, Eric"
				Warns against things coming to blows again
			A third voice enters the coversation
		Tetron checks in with Alistair
			He's trying to think of a way to do this without fighting...
			Tetron offers invisibility
			Alistair decides to wait for the conversation to die down
		Eventually, the argument starts to abate
			Not before a wall gets punched first
			"Fucking stupid idiot left the window open", and closes the window
		Issue: Alistair doesn't know which windows correspond to what rooms inside the barracks
		Tetron checks in again
			Quiet now, window closed
			At least three others who are watching Mateo
			Wondering if there's a way to go in and block the doors
			Tetron proposes Illusory Creature as a distraction
			Alistair suggests that we create more distractions around
				Might draw them out
				Ask Belladonna for advice
		Belladonna's recommendation for distraction
			She's had a chance to analyze the comings and goings
			She suggests going to the second floor and cause a distraction there
				Tetron: Illusory creature could cause a scene there
					Doors are a problem, though...
		Alistair analyzes the comings and goings himself
			20 or so people likely sleep within
			Guards are also there and have been doing shift swaps
			Could follow on someone's heels while invisible
				He discusses this with Tetron
					Would be dangerous if Alistair gets found
		Viola has a suggestion: I could go in as a guard and warn about a bomb threat
			Tetron sends along an illusory creature
			Viola and the doppelganger go up urgently and give the warning
				Don't want to start a panic...
				Daniel goes around to gather everyone, claiming a "company meeting"
				Everyone outside
				Viola asks for the minors to be separated for "security purposes"
					She fools Daniel, and three minors (including Mateo) follow Tetron's illusion
						Viola enters the building
						As the kids get to the sewer, Tetron AOE-casts Sleep against the non-Mateo kids
						Mateo is stunned as the other kids conk out
						Tetron pops out: We're friends of Alistair
						Belladonna takes Mateo in for a long hug
							"I'm so sorry!  I messed up!"
						Tetron closes the sewer entrance
						The illusion shouts at the kids to wake them up
							They're confused and panicking
							One makes a break for the meeting hall
								Illusion demands that he hang tight
						Belladonna, with our permission, escorts Mateo back
						Tetron asks Krug what he should do with the kids
							Continue coordinating evac?
		Tetron checks in with Alistair
			What now?
			Alistair: He and Cara are going to take their shit; just need a few minutes
		Tetron's illusion directs them away with the excuse that they need to look for Mateo
		Alistair turns to Cara and asks if she thinks they hide their valuables inside
			Hellz yeah
			They make for the Clutch's rooms, since most of the barracks is just guards
			Alistair throws a grapple to get up to Mateo's window
			Window isn't locked or anything, so he and Cara enter
			Door to the hall is open
				Other doors open, revealing multiple single-occupant rooms
			Alistair: Let's split up to do this fast, then meet to tackle the large room together
				Alistair enters a sparce room
					He sees make-up, so this must be Frey's room
					Rack of handheld weapons, some missing
						Any magic or fancy ones?
							One magic mace (an extra of the one she normally carries)
							Some nicely engraved knives
							Grabs the mace
					Some small carved art pieces of relatively low value
					He checks for hidden spaces
						He finds, under her bed, a nicely-carved idol, that seems to have superstitious significance
							Any traps?  Nope.
							He grabs it.
				Cara muttering to herself "what the fuck is this shit?"
					She shows him a strange selection of items
						It's BDSM equipment, but Alistair wouldn't know
					She did take some bag full of stuff
		Meanwhile, Viola acts like she's looking for the bomb
			One she's done on the ground level, she heads upstairs to look for Clutch stuff
			She comes across Alistair and Cara as they're rifling through the big room
			This room has books
			Viola takes an inkwell and pours the words "NO BOMB HA HA" all over the bedding
			Alistair and Cara keep looking for stuff
				Mounted on the wall is a large piece of art
					Looks like a massive city
				A chest in the corner
					Above it is mounted a hatchet
						Slivers of silver and fine wood for the handle
						Blade is very finely crafted, has marbling
						Neither of them catch the trap on it
							Alistair is unaffected
							Cara takes the full force of the shock
						Alistair takes the hatchet
		Tetron's illusion's kids hear the explosion from the trap
			He keeps them close
			However, multiple people leave the meeting and make for the building
		Time to go
			Viola makes for the rear window
			Alistair hoists the chest, Cara opens the window, and he chucks it out, and it breaks from the impact
			They all jump down
			Contents of chest: stacks of papers, shitton of gold, various strange objects, small weapons
				Alistair pries it open more and then uses his bag of holding to scoop stuff out
			One person comes around the corner and asks what the hell is going on
			Alistair scoops once more, activates his bracelet of dashing, then makes a break for it
			Dude rages behind him and speeds up, but still can't keep up with Alistair
				But he's faster than Cara
				Alistair yells to scatter
		Krug and Tetron emerge to investigate the noise
			They come up on Alistair, Cara, and Eric
		INITIATIVE!
			Round 1
				Cara recognizes Frey, draws a dagger, backs up, and then fails to trick the enemies with a signal
				Angry guy runs up to Alistair, pulls out a hatchet, then swings it into Alistair, but Krug Glimpses that (Eric hesitates)
				Viola runs back, but stops short of rounding a corner to hide, but she makes noise
				Frey approaches Krug and Tetron, draws a mace, then swings it into Krug
				Punchy guy runs over to support Frey, then crit-punches Tetron, knocking him over
				Tetron stands up, then steps as he casts Lightning Bolt to hit both Frey and punchy guy (punchy guy fails, Frey succeeds)
				Alistair stows his bag of holding, draws his sword, then stabs angry guy
					But dude resists physical damage
				Krug takes his shield in both hands, rages, then raises his shield
			Round 2
				Cara moves to flank angry guy then misses two stabs against him
				Angry guy turns to Cara and grabs her, then slashes her, then chokes on an attempt to intimidate her
				Viola tumbles past Frey on her way to use a finishing move on punchy guy
				Frey appeals to Alistair (I don't want to kill you, leave!), moves to get out of the flank, then trips Viola, then stomps on her head, breaking the feather
					"You should just surrender, Miss Frey!"
				Punchy guy punches down at Viola twice (Krug glimpses the second one, and dude takes enfeebled), then pulls out handcuffs
				Tetron AOE-casts Sleep above Viola to get Frey and punchy guy (Frey succeeds, punchy guy falls asleep, dropping the cuffs), then retreats away from the action
				Alistair moves to flank Frey, stabs her, then misses a second attack
				Krug moves to flank angry guy, shield bashes him, then raises his shield
			End-of-round goings-on
				Others start calling for aid
				Faint shouting starts coming (police coming?)
				Stareye is on his way
			Round 3
				Cara is super beat up and makes a run for it
				Angry guy says that they can still kill a few of us before the cops show up, strafes around Krug, then misses two slices
				Viola kips up, fails a bon mot against Frey, completely botches a feint, then takes a defensive pose
				Frey trips Alistair, tells Alistair that she will retaliate if he hits her again, then fails to hit Viola
				Punchy guy is asleep
				Tetron Hastes Krug, then retreats further
				Alistair stands up, grabs Frey, then presses that she's lost, but she still doesn't waver
				Krug misses two shield bashes, crits with a third, then raises his shield
			Round 4
				Stareye sprints up, says that he's got the police coming, then fools angry guy with a feint
				Angry guy swings thrice at Stareye, but only hits on the third (Krug glimpses)
				Viola gets to Frey by mentioning that Stareye is here now, fails a feint, then dueling parries
				Frey slips free from Alistair, shakes punchy guy awake, then asks angry guy if they are fighting or leaving
				Punchy guy swings at Viola twice and misses, then says that, even if we get away, he'll remember us
					"Okay, my name's Viola"
				Tetron reach-casts Charm at angry guy, but he resists us
					9 turns remain for Krug haste
				Alistair grabs Frey again, tries and fails twice to disarm her
				Krug shield bashes angry guy, then misses two more bashes, then raises his shield
			Wrapping up
				Police start to arrive, demand dropping of weapons
				Eric goes crazy in his failed attempts to attack Krug and Stareye
				Viola takes a few more punches
				Tetron casts Invisibility
				Everyone gets cuffed
				They find out about the "credible" bomb threat
