Moonday late evening
	Quickfall Abbey, interior
		Iris quietly opens the disarmed door
			Large statues inside the room
				Knight on a horse
			Individual sitting at a desk
				Wood and wrought metal
				Female halfling
					Preusing some paperwork
					Holding half a pomegranate and eating the seeds
					Gives Iris a one-moment finger
			Dark green rug on the floor
			Bookshelves, chests, torches
			Something embedded in the rear wall
				Inside a glass enclosure
			"Joyous tidings, I see you."
				She looks up and smiles in a complicated manner
					Iris notices her looking at Tetron
					Iris can also tell that she is not taking us seriously
				She invites us in
					We all enter
					She introduces herself as Chief Constable Roani Cheliff
					She asks why we're here
						Viola explains that we didn't expect to find a Taldan official's office under an abandoned church
							She knocks on her desk, which makes two different sounds
								Tetron asks about this
								Her office is effectively in two places at once
					She says she doesn't have an appointment for the next 20 minutes, so she doesn't mind our presence
						Viola: It seems like you know who we are and also that we know who you are
							Cheliff: Yeah, but we needn't fight
								Tetron: We tend to ask questions first, fight later
						Cheliff explains that she's really only aligned with the Coalition because she sees them as the only viable force against Cheliax
							Tetron asks her how she feels about recent Taldan politics
								She was too low in the hierarchy at the time
								But Eutropia is her queen
								She appreciates that Eutropia stabilized things
						Tetron: But what about the Coalition's actual goals?
							Cheliff: yeah, things have seemed kind of strange in the last couple of weeks
							She's willing to work with us 
							She turns to Iris
								She acknowledges that Iris is Arazni-aligned and has joined the party
									And bopped the necromancer, who was apparently Sloane-aligned
								She's willing to look the other way regarding Iris's parents
							She's also willing to point us toward rescuing the Olgirs
								They're being moved soon
							She also turns to Viola
								A certain criminal of interest is being executed soon, and she is the only person who can override it or arrange some kind of contact
					Tetron, suspicious of whether this is legit, goes to look around
						Cheliff warns Tetron to not mess with the doors
							His temporal and physical security wouldn't be guaranteed
								Viola: Temporal?
									A local family acquired multiple goods, one of which was three time spirits
										They got loose, and she now has one of them
					Tetron: so, what do you want?
						I know that you're really set on your stuff, and I like living
						Iris: Wait, first, why bring us here?
							You found me
						She wants us to look past her involvement with the Coalition and the location of Khadija
						Lies of omission:
							Tetron: He could tell that Cheliff was trying to not stare at his Lotheed insignia
							Tetron: The bargain is not congruent; she wants something that she hasn't actually mentioned
							Viola: Her greeting is an odd phrase; I've heard it from certain people before, perhaps performing on the streets of Taldor
					Negotiations stall
						Viola does admit that we don't know where Khadija is
						Viola desparately attempts to inform Cheliff that Baron Bain is a dragon
							She already knows
					We leave
				We wait the remainder of the 20 minutes, then open the door again
					It's empty save for the plainest of desks
				Alistair: while we were in Cheliff's office, could Borgon sense Amos?
					No
				Thoughts about Cheliff's claimed connection to Cur's Tooth
					Krug recognizes the snake from the trap as the same kind as the merchant in Cur's Tooth had
	We emerge and it looks like time is normal for us
		Tetron: We should turn in the badges
		Alistair asks to split off to sus out the necromancer's shop
			Sure
	Hosetter
		When we present ourselves to the front desk, the person informs us that a missive came in for us
			They walk us to the Lt Col
			Tetron jokingly asks if "the colonel" is unavailable
				The base is small enough that a Lt Col is the highest rank for the command job
		Lt Col's office
			Matilede Buracir (half-elf or elf?)
			She's holding a paper
			She expresses pleasure that we got her summons
				Except coincidence
			She gives us a note
				Tessra bit off her own tongue and drowned in her own blood
			She has it on confidence that this was indeed a suicide and not murder
				Tetron is still in disbelief
				Buracir assures that Tessra would have been under frequent and prolonged supervision
			Iris takes the gap in conversation to inform her that we found the bodies
				She thanks us
				Tetron: How do you intend to avenge this?
					Would need to contact Almas
						Viola warns her that Cheliff is Coalition
					Tetron: Any follow-up actions we can take?
						Once Hosetter intel has done its thing, she'll get back to us
			We head out
	Tetron: Should we pick a new inn?
		What about Alistair?
			Right.
	Marshcricket Lane with Alistair
		Finds the dude's clockwork/curiosity shop
			Adjacent establishments closed
			It has a second-floor residence
				Alistair goes to roofs and peeks in
					Two individuals inside
						30-yo woman and 5-yo boy
					Finds an alternate window for the bathroom
						Lots of ticking and chiming sounds
				Inside
					Emerges into a hallway
						Doors closed
							He checks them
								He finds the office
									Floor-to-ceiling stacked with documents
									Hoarder shit
									Finds a file about Orthodox Exaltists
										Fringe Taldan political group
										Had to change course after War for the Crown
										Positions
											Isolationism
											Traditionalism
											Hating Eutropia
										No names
									Finds two magical in-progress clockwork items
										Both are necromantic, one stronger than the other
									Money
										Gems, valuable magic components, small stash of coinage (two hundo)
											He takes the gems and coin pouch
					Downstairs
						Clocks, clockwork toys, art stuff
						Alistair looks for possible clockwork thievery tools
							Finds a case of devices that attach to or go under doors
							He grabs three crab-like devices that crawl under doors
						Shinies?
							Glass case roped off containing a mannequin head wearing some kind of device with lots of gems and probably magic
								This is almost certainly properly secured
									Alistair looks for traps
										Elaborate
										He leaves it alone
						Register
							Total of 350 gp
							He takes 100
						Anything useful to others in the party?
							Something that looks like it attaches to a bladed weapon
								Illusory
							Something that looks like it attaches to a chestplate
								Necromantic
							He takes both
						Paperwork?
							Nothing out of the ordinary
						He does some rearranging to make the thievery less obvious
						Also finds two clockwork necromantic grenades
			Back out the bathroom window
	Alistair returns late
		He presents money and the gadgets
			Asks Tetron to identify
				Chestplate: Some portion of damage is instead temp HP
				Blade: -1 to hit but increased damage
				Grenades: Splash heal, plus quickened for 1 round
				Crabs: Scuttle in, observe, scuttle back
			The gems are pre-cut
Bedtime
	A few hours after sleep, Tetron is poked awake by Taranis
		He reports that Tetron's staff is acting unusually
		"Guess I'll take this call."
		Inside the staff's space
			Mirror Tetron is sitting in a chair
				Seemingly in thought
			Claims to not be expecting Tetron
				Haven't spoken in a while
			Mirror Tetron's image is crisper than it has previously been
				It looks like he's trying to project this image of thoughtfulness
				But, he's burying frustration
				Also, Tetron can see something beneath the image
					But it doesn't look like a doppelganger...
					Human skin and flesh, similar to, but not quite, Tetron's
			So what's going on?
				He thinks that Tetron's efforts in negotiating with Cheliff and the Adept LAP trial were very good
				He expected that, by now, Tetron would have committed to either friendship with or use of his companions
					Tetron: What would you expect?
						Use
						Seems a lot more congruent with what he experienced in the Alsetan Temple
						He accuses Tetron of not caring for the rest of us
						Would be more effective toward goals if he used us more
						Tetron: Give me an example
							After meeting the Kaulfields, his actions served the others better than himself
					Tetron: Before taking on my visage, would you say you had companions?
						Not particularly
						Follow-up: Would your strength come from this lack of connection?
							It doesn't understand
							It just doesn't see what the benefit is
								Tetron: Having allies helps
									Mirror: They are allies?
										Yes
										Why?
											Tetron notices that, rather than it being a question of curiosity, it's more an accusation
											Tetron's seen companionship help others
										Would he sacrifice one or more of the others to attain power?
											It thinks that he would have said yes when they first met
											Tetron: Are you offering?
												Hypothetical
											Growth requires sacrifice
				Tetron changes the subject: you look different
					It's surprised
					Tetron rattles off a list of his relatives
						It cocks its head in an oddly impressed way, but keeps a decent poker face
					Tetron: Are you aware of me having thoughts that aren't my own?
						Yes
						And you're the source, yes?
							Apologies.
							Tetron: Tell me what your deal is or stop negging me
								A doppelganger corpse levitates out
								Mirror Tetron says he'll drop the pretense and accuses Tetron's performance as mediocre
									It's Targane
									The doppelganger was a good pretense
									He offers great power as he grows his own
									He wants Tetron to drop the rest of us
				Tetron: Do you even have any power?
					Targane: May I occupy your body?
						Briefly, sure, and no hurting anyone
						Tetron's body flies out the window, into the sky, and casts a ton of spells Tetron doesn't know
					Targane: My spellbook is far beyond yours, your perception could increase
						Abandon them and you can pursue great things
							Viola is less than useless in several fights
							Krug refuses to bend the truth
							Alistair is a child
							Iris is fine
							You could be more
						Tetron: But what do you have to gain?
							Your body and my power means I can reside on this plane
							Then Tetron lives in the staff
								But he gains so much power, including the means to not just manipulate, but subjugate others
	Alistair was woken up by Tetron's shit
		Flopped back on the bed after coming back
		Tetron wakes up
		Alistair: Were you doing anything important?
			Tetron: We should talk about this as a party in the morning
		Taranis has been trying to wake Viola by tapping on her hat
		Alistair messages Taranis: Is Tetron okay?
			Physically, yes, but he doesn't know what's going on
		Taranis perches on Tetron: Are you okay?
			No, but you should be in on the conversation tomorrow
Toilday morning
	Alistair mentions the necromancer's connection to Orthodox Exaltists
	Tetron fumbles trying to find a way to communicate his predicament to us
		Eventually realizes that he might be able to use others' lip reading
		He says we should go get breakfast
			He leaves the staff with Taranis and Borgon
	Breakfast
		Hashbrowns and eggs
		Tetron verfies that Alistair can read his lips
			"I don't know if he can hear, I don't know if he can see, but I'm going to try this"
			Iris can understand too
			He explains the gist of the situation
				"I fear I am in great danger."
				Acknowledges that Alistair saw him fly out the window
				Destroy staff or something else
					Though destroying staff might be worse
		Tetron goes to fetch his staff
			He makes a point of taking a lengthy trip to the restroom
			Iris waits a sec and then says what the deal is
				Alistair: Tetron floated the idea of destroying the staff, but he's not sure
				Krug doesn't know whether a temple would be able to properly handle it
				Iris is pretty sure it doesn't qualify as a curse, but it would depend on the circumstances of inhabitance
					Alistair: Could Pharasma take issue with this?
						Iris: Probably, but would take a pretty powerful person
							A wizard might also be able to help
		Division of labor for servant roles
			Viola: Should definitely be with Margot
			What are we actually looking for?
				Should probably investigate whatever nonsense the Bains are doing
					Viola: Iris should be able to snoop around for mystical stuff
			Krug as coachman
			Iris and Alistair as footmen
			Tetron as another attendant to Margot
	Tetron makes his haste scrolls and distributes them
		Not for Krug
	Alistair hands over an "animal tile" for Tetron to identify
		It adapts your vision to that of an animal of the user's choosing
		Consumable
	To the tailor!
		Stuff in stock for human-sized folks
			Would need to do alterations for Alistair
			Would need make rush order for Krug
		Tetron has to shave, though
			And restyle his hair
