Moonday night
	Iris dreams
		She steps into the pyre, surrounded by brightness, approaching her arm
		The smell of burning strengthens
			Smoke catches her attention first
	Iris shoots awake to find herself in darkness in Sloane's room
		Not even a candle lit
		She checks if Sloane is still here
			She turns over - the room is barely lit by the rain-filtered moonlight, just enough for Iris's ganzi eyes
			Two figures on the floor, one pinning the other
				The pinner is using their elbow to choke the pinee
				The pinner is also holding three knives in their other hand
				Iris finally internalizes the situation: Sloane has pinned a devil to the floor
					There seems to be some telepathic communication occuring
					The room is completely silent - seemingly a Silence spell cast by the intruder
			Iris rises, produces her blade, and puts the tip against the temple of the devil
				The devil is feminine, a contract devil, and has stopped strugging against Sloane's pin
					She is clutching a scroll
			Iris snaps her finger next to her ear as a gesture to indicate to drop the silencing effect
				The devil makes a motion in response, indicating her inability to move
				Sloane pivots to make the devil's hands available without releasing her arms
			The devil expresses frustration with the welcome given to a mere messenger
				Sloane demands that the devil relay what she told her to Iris
					The devil says that she merely wished to have a word with Iris
					She has something for Iris - a better deal, but she'd prefer to be allowed to stand
						Iris denies the request
					In the devil's hand is terms and conditions for the House Thrune Black Card
						Two items that are important:
							The cardholder must purchase AND DELIVER the item to House Thrune
								And the item/creature is no longer in Iris's possession
							These cards are to be used by the "approved" members of the Kaulfield family
								And Iris is not listed as an approved member
								Iris should find her name on the house's ledgers
									It'd make the retaliation less severe
					Iris presumes that the retaliation would be her capture and/or death
						A tad severe...
						However, Iris and the rest of the Radiant Dawn have proved irksome
					A "sealing kiss" would be sufficient to update her name in the records
						And this may make things less difficult for Iris
						Iris goes off on the devil about House Thrune having better things to do than to send a debt collector after a single woman.  And if they do want to make things difficult, Iris will move them up in her list of priorities.
			With the terrifying threat, the devil acknowledges that no further discussion would be helpful
				She asks to be allowed to leave
				Iris stabs her instead
INITIATIVE
	Iris demoralizes the contract devil
	Round 1
		Sloane misses two stabs, then loses the grapple
		Iris analyzes the devil, then stabs twice (hit, crit miss)
			The contract devil is specific to one of the more prominent districts in Egorian, handling such matters as naval recruitment contracts
			Name: Prosperpina
		Prosperpina rises to her feet, makes a break for the door (gets smacked by Iris on the way by)
	Round 2
		Sloane slips between the devil and the door to flank, then stabs twice (hit, hit)
		Iris intensifies vulnerability, then stabs twice (hit, hit)
		Prosperpina attempts to slip past Sloane to escape, but Iris stabs her through the spine and into the floor (crit), killing her
After combat
	Various people in the building have been roused by the sounds of combat
		Sloane takes point in explaining, kicking the body back inside and closing the door
	Prosperpina was carrying all kinds of paperwork
		Devils don't truly die if killed outside of Hell, so she will come back in some form eventually
		Iris loots 26 contracts
			One of which is Abigale's employment contract
				It has been amended
					Original version had standard ship's captain affordances
					The revision has her commanding a fleet of four ships
						Transport-related devils have been cycled out of her crew, replaced with combat-oriented devils
						Term is 1 year, renewable up to five
						This also provides the names of the captains of the other three ships
						However, her rank remains at Captain
							She has two discipline reports
								One was our operation
								The other was on 24 Arodus
		Iris also harvests some esoterica from the body
		After a minute, the body immolates
	Sloane returns after quelling the others
		Iris apologizes for getting Sloane dragged into this
		Sloane suggests that Iris inform the rest of the party about the incident
		Both agree that their reaction was quick
		Iris suggests that perhaps they get their own room at the Black Pit Tavern for better security
			Sloane agrees - "so many things are in pursuit of both of us"
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world
	In Tian Xia, A hanging piece of bamboo clatters in the storm of the Godsrain
	Terwa Lake's water has taken on the red color of the giant crystals that rise from its surface
	The Eye of Abadengo swells
	The orcs of the Hold of Belkzen celebrate Mahja's ascension
	The mist that ordinarily coats the Lake of Mists and Veils has been beaten down by the rain
Krug dreams, a memory
	A hundred orcs mill about in a space strewn with furs
	A staff is thrown to Krug
		He catches it just in time to use it to defend himself from an older male he's suddenly sparring
		But his opponent makes another swing, and Krug's wooden shield breaks under the force
		The older male berates him for being weak and soft for continuing to use a shield, despite prior "advice"
		Krug swings back, but his staff is plucked from his hand
		The older male lays into him about his behavior
			Saying that Mahja shows up like twice, and Krug's head is filled with lies
			Doesn't help with confronting the Empty Hand Tribe
			He's ashamed to let Krug even be seen in public
			Krug: There has to be a better way; how can you be so blind?
				I'm sorry to disappoint you
			He hopes that Mahja dies with forgiveness on her lips
				And that Krug is there to see it
				"You will be weak forever!"
					"Maybe that's the case, maybe I will be weak, but what you define as 'strength' comes at too high a cost, and I can't be a part of that."
						"Krug, you WILL be a part of it."
		Others sparring around take notice
			One gives a signal
				Indicating something to come that has happened before
				Krug is whipped.  Again.
Sleep for all of us is uneasy
Toilday morning
	Black Pit Tavern
		We wake, sweating through our bedding
			Our familiars are also restless
		The rain continues, though not heavy
		This evening will be our first appearance at the tribunal
	Sloane and Iris move over
		The streets of Cassomir are deserted, save for a smattering of guards
			Occassional wails and screams
			Iris figures that this would make for good protection from an ambush
			Sloane isn't bothered by the Godsrain, given how extraordinary recent events have already been
		Iris cedes decoration of their room to Sloane
	Black Pit Tavern
		Iris pops in, covered in the devil's blood
		Iris explains the events of the previous night
			She figures that the Andoren military might be interested in the documents she recovered
		Krug mentions that his dreams revisited a low point in his life
		Tetron casts Sending
			Target: Cyrus
			Message: So Gorum is dead. We're fine over here, though. I've been turned into a centaur. How are things with you?
			Response: Well, it was certainly an interesting evening for myself and my companions. I was going to tell you today: we're in Cassomir, and I believe we'll be seeing you tonight.
		Tetron casts it again to ask for a meeting spot, preferably on the Taldan side
			Cyrus is staying in an inn off Marshcricket Lane, but it's loud.  He suggests Vaylen Park at 4.
	Hosetter
		The base is on basically yellow alert
			There isn't even anyone at the reception desk
		Buracir's office is unoccupied
			Someone does notice us
				Buracir is busy, but he goes to find her
		Buracir opens up and lets us in
			She says that they are already handling "the attack"
				Wut
				Spillover has been attacked (30% destroyed), long-range communication is down, unknown status of Prig's temple
					City wall also hit, doing some damage to Tamuth and Woonhal
						High damage, but relatively low loss of life
					Arcane cannonfire responsible
						Iris nods knowingly
						Firing ship was an Andoren vessel, taken over by Chelaxian forces
							When Andoren forces reclaimed the ship, all crew was all dead but one
								Arnault communicated some vital info before succumbing to her injuries
			Buracir remembers that we called her
				Iris hands over the contracts for her sister and associates
				Buracir asks to take it
					Iris: that's why I brought it
				Tetron asks what these are worth
					Buracir says that compensation is definitely in order
					Iris: I mean, I won't say no, but that's not why I brought it
				Buracir is quickly swept up in further responsibility and we head out
	To the Great Eye
		Tetron suggests the trip to get a head start on the final fey
		We knock on the door, and an older goblin woman answers
			"Curious day to come to this place."
			Viola explains that we're here about the disturbances
				"Do you know anything about the arcane arts?"
				Tetron steps up and suavely introduces himself
					She knows of Merginus - he worked closely with Botwati, who is apparently within
		The goblin leads us up a spiral staircase
			At the top is another goblin at a blackboard
				A handful of assistants are about
			We listen to the existing conversations
				Something about ley lines shifting in the wake of the Godsrain, but calculations and observations are only preliminary
			Botwati is looking at a map that is dotted with radiating points
				Tetron peers to see if the primal well he drank from is on there
					It is, with multiple notes tacked to it - a moderate font of power
					Looks like dude knows more about the site than Tetron does
				He's specifically looking at nodes in the local area
					One on the eastern city wall, connected to three other spots
						A municipal well or fountain
						A residence
						A business
							The latter two pins had been removed
					Second point is near a settlement called Slatedown
			Tetron starts conversation: a great interest in fonts of power, eh?
				Gotta work around them
				They attract creatures sensitive to them
					One of the three predictors for attacks or magical disasters
			Introductions
				How did he know Merginus?
					He contracted the Great Eye for multiple months during wartime
					But even prior, there was a connection through Merginus's association with horses, as Al-Zabriti horses have magical sensitivity and can even draw strength from fonts of power
				So, what is Tetron here for?
					To learn what's going on here, to appreciate it
					He points to the primal well on the map
						How'd it taste?
							Better than how it felt the next night
							Botwati was curious whether such places occupied by dark beings would have a different taste
								He's tasted quite a few in his time
						Tetron asks what else he can expect from the metamorphosis
							Not much, beyond perhaps helping to build a tolerance
							It's going to hurt just as much turning back
								He offers a draught to help with the reversion pain
									Tetron uses this to pivot to the topic of the fey
			The notice was more of a warning than a request
				Time magic is dangerous, yo
				The removed pins were previous sites of temporal distortion
				The last pin at the well is ordinarily occupied by a benign minor aquatic fey
					But she's been recently been "granted" additional magics
					She's taken hostage multiple local people
						No demands, though
						Especially since the "hostages" are willing occupants of the effect
				However, Chateau Batiste is the bigger issue
					Two Adept LAPs have gone in and have not returned
					Warning: Don't bring timekeeping devices, and don't cast Time Sense
						Also, space-tracking stuff is also inadvisable
			Alistair takes a quick peek to see if he can find additional Alseta portals
				It's a different map layer that's folded to the back right now, but they definitely have the info
	Over to the fey well
		Except we should grab case files on the missing persons from Greyguard
		WAIT NILBOG
	Back to the Black Pit Tavern
		We summon Chimpy
			Except we don't
				Can we not do it here?
					Quick test at Quickfall
						Success!
							Uh... it's a future Chimpy
