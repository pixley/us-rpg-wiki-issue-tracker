Tetron gets overwhelming, crippling fear
	Voice that isn't his: "why is the Shield of Aroden in this boy's hand?!"
	Tetron has a panic attack, and the rest of us can tell
	Tetron sees memories he doesn't have, with people he's never met
		Brought into some kind of dream starscape
	Viola and Krug try to check on him, but he's basically catatonic
	Tetron tries to focus on the memories
		Tetron's POV is taller than Tetron is; white robes, tight-fit tunic
		Walking through a cavern system; dripping of water
		To his right, an arm pats reassuring
			Light green hair; gnome, young, male
				"Are you nervous?"
			POV man responds: "who wouldn't be"; sounds more confident
		Other people around, but can't see them
		Not sure what they'll find ahead
		FOV turns from gnome deeper into the cavern; moon and starlight coming through a hole in the ceiling, almost blinding; it's cold, there's a mist
	Rest of party debates taking it from him, but he's gripping it tightly, and they're afraid to handle it himself
	Visions continue:
		After further travel, same day?
		Facing a large body of water; snowy mountains in the distance; coniferous trees
			Probably in the north
			Water is covered in a thin layer of ice
		Tetron tries to identify the location:
			Not necessarily in the far north if it's wintertime
			Thick mist covers the water, hard to make out past 10 feet
		Rustling sound behind, same gnome takes out ice picks and distributes them
			Gnome is wearing a scarf (light green) now
		Companions moving heavy logs or something behind
		Gnome tapping on the ice, listening for something
		He picks a location and the group starts breaking through, water underneath is frigid
	Alistair determines that the brooch isn't actively doing anything
	Nilbog takes a look at him; almost like he's dreaming
		Not sure if it's dangerous for Tetron to be like this, probably not great to wake him up suddenly
		Nilbog decides to rub his face with wet hands
		It works
	Tetron puts away the shield
	Tetron explains the voice and visions
	Tetron admits that he probably does know what it is, but it's too dangerous to tell us
	Tetron asks for the Pellsieve to look for places that would match the description
		He identifies the Lake of Mists and Veils as an incredibly likely candidate
Party goes to lunch to chat about what to do for the rest of the day
	Discuss the various jobs, not especially sure about any of them
	Zaknos decides to head back and have Chimpy help him look for snargies
		Chimpy says he can ask Zaknos's mom for advice on finding them
		And by that, he means opening some kind of portal to a hospice facility, revealing Zaknos's mother
		She's looking at a bird out the window
		Rules for contact:
			It's a one-way window; Chimpy can make it two-way, but specifically not for Zaknos
			Chimpy can go through in disguise (a small ephemeral child version of Zaknos)
			Window can be opened whenever Zaknos wants
		She doesn't seem to be bothered by the intrusion
		Chimpy starts to give an update to her
			He's been assigned to Zaknos - he misses and loves her and is looking for snargies
		She starts to tell Chimpy about snargies (they're small, cute, and helpful)
		Chimpy reports back; she gave tips
		They find a small hole, Chimpy transforms into a tiny animal and finds a shiny acorn
	Tetron goes to earn income with potion making for the day
	Viola and Krug return to the church of Abadar to take another shot at removing the curse
		Fail again
		Viola asks if the priestess can at least determine what the curse specifically does
			No physiological issue with the heartbeats
			Recommends removal at a larger city like Almas
			She suggests that a raja rakshasa was responsible
			She offers to try one more time for 1 gp, since she feels bad about the repeated failure
	Alistair goes to Zven to look for magic lockpicks
		Zven isn't there right now
		Alistair notices a small brown animal run across some nearby rooftops
		Then Zven arrives
		Alistair inquires
		Zven has a skeleton key in stock; purchased at sticker price
		Zven looks more unkempt than usual, patting at sweat, picking leaves out of his clothes
	Does Krug want to do anything for an hour?
		Nope, so Viola suggests popping over to the Fleet District to do some window shopping
	Alistair looks for a shrine to Cayden Cailean
		Finds a tavern instead
		Looking to contribute to some kind of charitable cause
		He looks to find a trustworthy-looking worshipper; finds a full-bellied gnome bartender and a more plainly dressed woman
		Alistair approaches the gnome
			He asks to make a donation to someone who can help people in the city, under the guise of having a benefactor
			Gnome is thrilled, says that they can't do business without a drink, he pours cider for Alistair (might be too much for him) and they cheers
			"Helping the less fortunate", hands over 20 gp
			Likely to go toward folks in Copperdown
	Krug and Viola end up at Jameson's for the first time
		Viola considers bracelet of dashing vs ventriloquist's ring, picks up the latter
		Jameson was reading smut before they walked in
	Take three at curse removal
		Cleric puts extra effort
		SUCCESS
		Viola emerges victorious and declares not being able to hear her heartbeat anymore, much to the confusion of the people in the waiting room
	On the way back to the inn, Viola and Krug are joined by Amos
		He notes Viola's chipperness
			Viola explains the curse removal
			Amos knows what a raja rakshasa is, apparently in Oppara
		He asks where Zaknos is; Viola isn't sure
		He invites the party to dinner at a Minkaian restaurant (the Red Envelope)
		Message delivered, he heads elsewhere
	Zaknos, on the floor, dismisses Chimpy as Viola and Krug arrive
		They catch each other up
		They find Nilbog sitting by himself in front of Viola's door
Showtime
	Alistair changes into his darker clothes
	Zaknos takes the prompt to poke holes in his own clothes to blend in as well
	We find Blaire in Copperdown, her clothes are kind of run down and she's wearing a hood
	We wave at each other
	There's a second guy with the target
	They're patrolling on the overhead scaffolding
		It's high enough for falls to be pretty nasty
	Blaire shimmies up a dangly rope ladder
		These are normal for the area
	More secure ways up seem to be on private property
	Zaknos pretends to have a limp
	There are multiple layers to the scaffolds (2 or 3)
	Female and male guard
		We overhear the female: rare quiet night
		Male doesn't like the smell or the heights
		Male is Bram
		Female is Tura
	We cause a huge clusterfuck
		Viola approaches Bram under the pretense of asking for information on Griv and Anlo
	Interview with Bram
		He is working with Cheliax
		Gov't there has vested interest to make sure that Aegis Coalition doesn't get off the ground
			Coalition is trying to revive Aroden and bring about an age of glory
		It's paying enough to have him finance a home for his parents, who aren't doing well
		Wrapped up in an infernal contract
		Tura isn't supposed to know
	Tura telling off Tetron
		Ghost sound as attempt to distract, she bites
	Back with Bram
		Zaknos attempts to hold Blaire back
		We negotiate him to hand over his contract
			He's working for Astrid and friends
			If he finds a member of the coalition, take them out
			Breaking of contract: financing of parent's home is revoked
				Kind of implies death
			Could he back away from the guard, but he is supposed to be actively contributing
		We take him into custody and talk Blaire down
		Tura starts to head toward the scene
	Getting Bram down
		Through the izakaya's access
		Carrying him to HQ
At Augustana headquarters
	They insist that they need to speak to Barnes, and this is supported by Bram
	Barnes eating dinner in hear office
		Bram admits to lying to Barnes about how he came into the money
		She is surprised and expresses the seriousness of the crime
		He is taken to an interrogation room for further questioning
		Advise Barnes to be lenient, as the cooperation is helpful
	Tetron hands over the brooch shell
		60 gp for the job (10 extra!)
At Dockward Hold
	Viola beats Blaire there
	Viola reports successful mission, though Bram ended up in Guard custody
		Bram was indeed dirty
		Zaugia is non-plussed by that part, but Viola explains that the complication of there being a second guard forced the party's hand
		150 gp + 30 gp (for live capture)
		Zaugia knows of the Ashborn
	Zaugia is aware of Aegis Coalition's goals
		She is suspicious of their humanity-first slant
		Reports of unsavory methods to their goal
			Sexual assault
			Human trafficking
			Involvement in the Darkmoon Vale
				Not much in the way of further elaboration, though they were not responsible for the attack
				Viola expresses her desire to undermine whoever set Falcon's Hollow up for failure
		Viola double-checks that Zven wasn't the source of info on the Coalition
			He was not; Zaugia is distrustful of kitsune
	Viola reports on what Sloane's next mission is
		Dropping that the Iomedaen people involved are friends with Krug
			"The Cute One?"
	Blaire finally shows up
		Expresses dissatisfaction with the outcome
		Zaugia is impressed at the discretion
			Blaire makes a face
			Viola explains that they weren't so much discreet as responsible for a really good distraction
		Viola reports success in satisfying Margaret
			Blaire is pleased with the outcome
			Note that Margaret will likely try to contact
	Viola expresses interest in undoing the Ashborn Company's work
