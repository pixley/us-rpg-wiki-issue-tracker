Morning of Silverglazer Sunday
	Alistair ditches the party to go to the docks to look into the activities, particularlly for swimming
		Passes a bunch of carnival games
		Signs for "team racing", "diving/retrieval", "individual races"
		Stalls selling swim gear
		Plank hanging over the pier with concentric circles below (diving target competition?)
		Alistair looks into the individual races
			He signs up as an adult (3cp entry fee)
			Race prep starts at noon
		Puppets being hauled in to a stage of sorts further from the short
		Different attraction booths (magical amusements, fortune telling)
		Also food stalls, dishes in fish shapes
		He goes to play carnival games a while before realizing that he probably shouldn't have all his stuff on him when swimming
	The holiday celebrates gillmen bringing the fledgling Andoren gov't the keystone to the Arch of Aroden
		More popular among coastal cities
	Back at the Jaw and Mead
		Viola pitches going to the gov't ASAP
		One of the Bilgers comes in and asks about Rae
			They had taken care of her while we went out yesterday
			Viola yields the decision to someone who actually handles Rae: Tetron
			Tetron considers the situation regarding us taking a ship in the near future
				Unlikely that Amos would be taking us on a horse-compatible ship
			Tetron calls a team meeting
				Sell vs give to Bilgers
				We only paid 8 gp...
			We give Rae to them
				They're planning on heading outside town to start a farm
To the government!
	Outside the building, we see Eli and Gage
		They were summoned
	Inside, it's just Olorin today
		They've been doing some thinking: it is not possible for the gov't to lend their full support into our claims at this time
		The Aegis Coalition has a decent reputation within Andoran, and they would need strong evidence to pursue them
		However, given that it's a matter that concerns not just Andoran, they are planning to cooperate with the IMG to have us do the investigation independently
			Including proper licensing for our actions
			Anything that we do outside Andoran obviously can't have Andoren help
		Regarding Tessra
			She continues to be in custody
			Tough to interrogate
		Tetron's debt has been excused, and we've been paid
			300 gp (50 each)
	Eli turns to us
		He's surprised at our growth
		For making contact in other IMG cities, he gives us a note to hand over
			Tetron catches on that they're nervous
				They're alarmed at how quickly we've gone from certification to capturing a major villain
	After Eli and Gage leave, we discuss what to do about the stones
		The gov't has their one back in secure location
		Olorin says they won't force us to give up ours
		We decide to keep ours for now, just because everything we can think of has issues
Back on the town
	Tetron visits Jameson's for appraisal
		The ring is one of cold resist
		Marcellus's dagger is of unique make; cold iron, hitting a creature with it may heal you, not much else
	Tetron asks if Jameson is interested in the dagger
		A bit rustic for his typical client
		Might be able to sell it for a higher price near the woods or other places with fey issues
		Jameson's buying price: 175 gp (would be ~450 base price, so sells for )
			Jameson thinks it'd be better to sell elsewhere
	Tetron trades in the ring to help purchase an Endless Grimoire
Alistair at the festival
	Race prep
		Official basically says "don't cheat, either by mundane or magical means"
	GO!
		Water is murky, but he has goggles
		He feels like he's doing pretty well, but a few folks are keeping pace with him
		On the way back, he collides with a man going the opposite way
		Finished better than average
The rest join the festivities
	Viola goes to watch a few shows
		History of Andoran and Silverglazer Sunday
			Charicatures of Abrogail, Codwin, Talmador
		That's the only show they're doing, so Viola leaves after throwing a few copper in the tip jar
	Zaknos goes to look for a food eating contest
		Large table of pies (savory and sweet; team (3) and individual)
		Zaknos grabs Nilbog for it, and Nilbog grabs Krug
		The pies are Costco-sized
		Competitors are a team of dwarves and a team of two orcs and a human
		Zaknos excuses himself to then summon Chimpy in order to cheat
			Mess with their hair, mess with their food, tickle them
			Definitely no choking or killing
			If things get "too hot", unsummon himself
			Then he has Chimpy make him throw up
		He returns with Nilbog's hat with half-digested breakfast in it
		GO!
			Round 1: Zaknos and Nilbog tearing it up, but Krug isn't as into it
				Chimpy is tickling a dwarf's throat
			Round 2: Dwarves are trying to help their friend stop choking (Chimpy kicked one in the throat)
				Krug is picking up the pace, Nilbog is keeping up, and Zaknos is distracted by the hilarity of Chimpy's antics
			Round 3: Zaknos recalls Chimpy, the one human is basically done, and the dwarves are dealing with their friend
		Zaknos's team wins!
			The prize is two more pies and 10 gp
				3-3-4 split favoring Krug
		Zaknos goes to lay down
	Alistair goes to participate in the diving competition
		The competition isn't liable if he drowns
		Objective: dive and retrieve an object (time trial)
		GO!
			He swims out quickly
			A sack sits at the bottom of the harbor, seems to be filled with rocks
			He's having trouble lifting it, but makes it on the second pull
			He beats the current record
	Viola approaches a ring toss game
		She selects the hardest difficulty
		20 rings
			Unmarked bottles - 1 pt
			Marked bottles - 2 pts
			Tiny bottle up high - 10 pts
		She does mediocre (hits the tiny bottle once)
	Zaknos observing people walking by as he lays on the ground, looking for folks of Alistair's kind
		He pulls them in to hire them to play all the games (for a cut)
		It takes them all afternoon
	Tetron looks into the cantrip casters
		Not much interesting to him
		Then he goes to sell the stuff he transferred runes off of
			He goes back to Jameson's to look for a hat of the magi
	Alistair makes an attempt at the ring toss game
		Viola, eating a fish on a stick, warns about the ring weighting
		Alistair wins!  Carney is pissed
	Did Alistair win the diving game?
		Yes
		The prize is 10 gp
End of the evening, festival is wrapping up
	Zaknos's child labor returns
		The returns:
			Several fish-shaped breads
			Some pies
			Two dozen cookies (wave, fish, and gillmen shapes)
			Large bottle of wine
			A bunch of stuffed animals
			A caricature of one of the kids
		Zaknos offers a gold piece in exchange for the childrens' shares
			4 out of 5 accept the gold, one last kid wants to keep his caricature (he gets 5 sp instead)
			Zaknos shoves all the loot in his bag
	Party starts to shift toward the Oldtown Docks
		Viola knows that the end-of-day stuff is festival patron speech time and proclaim new charity events
		Crowd surrounding a podium as someone stands
			Unfamiliar voice (kind of nasally): thanks and normal closing remarks
				We're apparently standing where the dock fire was
			Primary sponsors: Sloane
				She apparently contributed to the rebuilding of the dock
				The cooperation between the Bulwark and Bolt and the Radiant Dawn is now public
				Sloane speaks:
					She's lived in Andoran for 10 years - MOTHERFUCKER
					Talks about being honored by the people's commitment to democracy
					She thanks the Radiant Dawn
					"Shining beacon of progress and hope"
			More sponsors...
			After speeches end, donors are talking to various people
				There's a line for Sloane
		Zaknos approaches with his big-ass basket of carnival food
			We're sus of him
			Tetron suggests throwing a party with the stuff
				Viola's tired and not into it
			Zaknos suggests taking it to an orphanage to donate
		Viola goes to bathe and sleep
			Tetron goes to bed too
Moonday morning
	Tetron is chatting with Mihail through his bedroom window
		He looked into something (that Tetron requested)
			Was working with Blaire and Zaugia
			He thinks it's odd that there's no discernable gathering of people hostile to the Andoren gov't
			He still finds Tetron's report concerning
			There is unrest after the fall of Falcon's Hollow and the drying up of timber
				Aid has been stalled in the People's Council
				He has reason to believe this may lead to a vote of no confidence in Andira in the coming weeks
				Reginald Cormuth seems to be the front-runner to replace her
		He found a point of contact in Almas for Tetron: Irontarn (dwarf, member of the Andoren military) at the Cerulean Keep
			She poses as an adventurer for much of the year, which could be a decent source of info
			He also believes that Professor Haufmain (satyr, head of literature dept.) at the University of Almas is a good point of contact as well
		Tetron really appreciates it
		He'll send word along to Almas if anything else comes up
	To Amos's house
		They're tidying up and packing
		After being greeted by Viola, Fleche calls for Amos
		Amos greets us carrying a quiver
			It's a gift for Zaknos
			It's enchanted such that it has infinite arrows
			"quiver of replenishing"
			It's engraved with "snargies" in purple
			Tetron is interested in taking the old quiver and the 100 arrows
				Telekinetic Projectile
			Zaknos tears up and Amos gives him a hug
		We confirm that we are indeed coming along
			The ship is the Silken Wave - he's ridden on it multiple times
			Sets off tonight
			About 4 day trip
			Zaknos takes a family suite
			Pairs are Tetron/Viola, Nilbog/Krug
			Alistair alone
			It's not an open ocean vessel, instead keeping close to shore
				Safe route
				Primarily carries cargo, but passengers sleep at the lowest deck
			Capacity: A dozen and a half passengers, likely mostly business travelers
			Warning: don't break laws on the ship
	Viola checks in with Barnes
		Reports about the professor who received the stone
			They already knew; he reported its arrival
		Viola advises about fake infernal contracts
		Barnes notifies Viola that they've taken Joan into protective custody outside town
		Barnes notifies Viola that Marcellus has checked himself into the mental hospital
	Alistair at the Bulwark and Bolt
		The place is closed; Sloane isn't in
		He goes to the flower shop that Zven operates out of instead
			The color drains from the florist's face - "You may be in the wrong establishment." Claiming to know nothing
				"Listen, I don't know who you're working for."  She doesn't want him coming in anymore because she's scared
					Zven hasn't been back there the past few days; she's afraid to open the door
					The last time she saw him, he was covered in blood (just after we left)
					She doesn't know whether he went for help and she didn't ask
					She offers to unlock the door to let him look around
			Zven's office
				CHECK FOR TRAPS HOLY FUCK - none detected
				As he starts to open the door, it catches and doesn't go further
				He can see light through the crack
				Obstruction: a large pot filled with dirt
				He can see inside
					Plants don't look like they've been watered recently
					The small desk that used to be in there is gone
						As are the files 
					Blood smeared across the floor
				He shoves the pot aside and checks for traps within
					CRIT SUCCESS - the window is trapped from the inside
				Looking for anything unrelated to plants
					Zven seems to have to come through the window, severely injured, gathered his shit, and left
					He finds one of those "JK" coins
					In the corner, he notices a hiding spot where it looks like a money stash has been mostly retrieved
						100 gp remains
					It definitely seems like no one has been here since Zven's departure
			He lets the florist know that the room has been emptied
				She's relieved
				Housing him paid well, but it seemed pretty sketch
				He does notify her of it needing to be cleaned
Pottery retrieval quest
	We find a beautiful exterior for a kiln/pottery shop
	Tetron says that we're interested in the quest
		She seems relieved
		She stops the spinning clay and cleans her hands off
	Name: Kaolin Zhang
	She had increased the bounty lately
	Her wares were on a mercantile ship that was attacked by Chelish forces
	Her large porcelain bowl was meant for an art show in Taldor
		Was outbound tonight (on our ship?  Was Amos the client?)
	We can't swim from shore; a small boat would need to take us out
	Problems:
		Area is technically Andoran-controlled, but functionally uncontrolled
		Dangers in the area
		Bowl is heavy and cumbersome
			Not carryable by one person
			It's also fragile
			It's a singing bowl
			It may have already broken
		Bowl is in a crate
			Should have "Kaolin" written on it
		She'll pay us back for any boat ride expenses
	Viola catches that Kaolin is nervous
		She presses on it, and aKolin tries to dodge
		Tetron catches on too
		She finally caves:
			It contains enchantment magic, which is illegal in Andoran
				It "enhances" the viewing experience of the stories engraved on it
			The ship wasn't attacked; the crew threw the pot overboard because they found the enchantment magic
			The enchantment would probably mess with whoever tried to retrieve it
	Who was the pot for?
		Fatima Rahal - famous horse keeper, non-noble
			Tetron knows about this person: he even has a card with her name on it; she is one of Atash Malak's associates
			She's famous for her beauty, but she covers herself
	Tetron recommends that Kolin meet us at the ship
		Viola is all like "yeah, it makes sense, probably not too many ships leaving at that specific time, and this sort of thing is Amos's wheelhouse"
		Kaolin recognizes Amos's name
			It's a small world

XP: None
