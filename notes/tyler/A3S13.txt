Toilday, early evening
	Zaknos is swept back into a memory
		He's looking up from a kneeling position towards his mother
		He must be young
		His mom is whittling and knicks her finger
			It's a small medallion with a spider on it
			She usually sews, so this is odd
		He asks her what it is
			She tells him about that particular spider as an icon for the Nidalese people
			He can carry it when he grows up into a "big strong man"
	Zaknos's pin has transformed from wood to a metallic material
	Prig calls out, asking what happened
		Tetron cuts her off to answer her in the affirmative
		"Is that what I'm turning into?"
			Viola: Not anymore
			Tetron: Choose your own destiny; she definitely chose hers
	Prig is uncertain about what this means for her
		The hag is her mom
		One of the priests steps in and clarifies that only her dad raised her, so he's the only real parent
		Viola: You are who you choose to be
	What about the "temple"?
		We did consecrate the site
		Isn't exactly laid out like a temple
		Kind of small
		Krug encourages her to just do it the way that makes her happy
			She's on-board
		Krug: How much did the materials cost?
			She's been working on it for 5 years
			Spent basically everything she's earned except for food
			He wants her to be able to do what she can
				He can help by giving some money if that'll make it easier to get materials
					She won't say no
					However, what would be nice... if he's planning on staying in the city for a bit, he could provide some manual help
						He's down once he has the time
	Prig turns to Nilbog
		She wasn't sure earlier about a lot of things
		He seems like a "proper" goblin
			He was born in a tribe
			He has the mutations
			She's just got a mound of rocks and 1 friend
			She envies him
				She doesn't like that feeling
				Could she be his friend instead?
					Nilbog accepts
	Prig suggests that these events were the real gift from Sarenrae
	It's dinner time, what about food?
		Zaknos suggests pizza
		Tetron isn't going
			He probably won't see us until morning
	Pizza time!
		Alistair: Should we go to the boat?
			Viola: No Tetron, no briefing or departure
		Zaknos: Should we find out where Tetron is?
			No and we don't care
		Krug: Anyone want to help with building the temple?
			Viola: Not strong enough
		Nilbog notices a small guy pulling out a knife to cut Zaknos's purse strings
			He gets up, pretending to go do something else and sneaks up behind the guy
			By the time Nilbog approaches, guy has cut off the bag
				He pretends to bump into the guy (him carrying some stuff from the table)
			All of us turn to notice, and Alistair recognizes the guy
				Pre-teen elf, his name is Lucas
				He quickly stashes the bag behind his back
				Nilbog outright accuses the guy
					Alistair asks him to give it back
					He does
					He stammers out a "I won't steal again"
					Alistair asks him to get a new purse for Zaknos
				Lucas walks away super deflated
		When Lucas returns, he has a new hand-made bag for Zaknos
			His apology is super insincere
			Viola recognizes him from the seminar the other night
				What happened?  He seemed so enthusiastic
				He claims to have needed some start-up money
					Viola: No, just start helping people
	Alistair follows Lucas back to the orphanage
		He overhears Elwynn chewing him out
			"He didn't look very strong..."  "That's not the point!"
			"There are other adventurers!"
		He walks in: "To be fair, he did pick the best target of the party."
			"You need to start smaller"
		He justifies it by saying that adventurers are rich
			Alistair: But we have to buy more stuff
				And you have to be really really good to go after adventurers
		Elwyn suggests that he find a specialty other than thievery
			He likes fighting
			Alistair: You need to find a balance in a group
		Alistair hangs out with his friends for the evening
	Viola goes to check in on Chase
		He's beaten up, but he got 2 gp from the other night
			One gp for each win
		He fractured a rib, though
			Viola insists that getting that looked at is part of living costs
		Next fight tonight
			Against a gnoll
				He doesn't know about silent 'g'
				Viola advises that he go for under-the-chin
					Soft tissue
					Counter to bite attacks
						Might even bite tongue
		Where does Chase train?
			At home with a grain bag and a ceiling beam
			Viola says that they need a proper place to spar
				Chase is surprise that Viola would spar - she uses a sword
					"If you can dodge a sword, you can dodge a fist"
	Krug and Nilbog go to get supplies for the temple
	Zaknos chats with Chimpy at the inn
		Chimpy reports that he omitted details yesterday
			Zaknos is proud
		Chimpy thanks Zaknos for reading his contract to him
		Chimpy: Do you trust your friends?
			Yeah, they do good stuff
			Chimpy mentions that he heard us talk shit about him
				Zaknos says that families just make fun of each other
					Chimpy: Am I your family?
						Yes
		Chimpy goes to file his report
	Tetron's dinner date
		Kind of a windy path to get there
		He finds himself at a little hole-in-the-wall place tucked between Flags and Saltgrass
		Strong scent of roasted duck
		He sees a finely-dressed Cyrus sitting at a table in the open-air dining area
			Some small item sits on the table in front of him
		Cyrus acknowledges that it's an unusual pick, but it's a hidden treasure
			He got turned onto it by Namira
		Cyrus doesn't know how Tetron survives when half the time adventuring is spent eating rations
			Yeah, oatmeal gets old
			The item is a gift to address that
		Tetron also has a gift for him: an ascot in the same style as the one Tetron got him as his first ever gift
		The gift for Tetron looks like a batch of sugar cubes, except pearlescent
			Tetron recognizes it: it's something you crush and sprinkle on food to make it taste as desired
				Better than what prestidigitation can do
			Cyrus got it specially enchanted
			Intent is for Tetron to be able to relive their favorites
		They get duck noodle soup
		Turns out Cyrus has an ulterior motive for taking Tetron out
			How long does Tetron intend to stick with the party?
				Do his plans six months or a year from now potentially include other people?
			Tetron explains that he feels compelled to see through what we started in Falcon's Hollow
				His military experience has informed him to be wary of things being out-of-balance
			Does Tetron still intend to become the strongest wizard?
				Yes, it's on the priority list
			What's Cyrus doing medium-term?
				After turtle stuff, defending his dissertation
			What's Cyrus's long-term?
				He wants to make it so that society can understand magical creatures better
					Not just as tools of war or anything
					How much better could we make society?
					He's driven by his less-than-fortunate background
						Can keep others from having to go hungry
						Tetron admires that
							"It's attractive"
		After dinner, Cyrus takes Tetron to Jubannich Memorial Park
			It's a cemetary, but the grass, wind, and river spray make it a wonderfully contemplative place
			Towards the end of the walk, he stops at a cliff and turns to Tetron
				He says that he's had a wonderful evening
				He invites Tetron to continue this "elsewhere", if he likes
				However, he says that this doesn't need to be an "isolated incident"
					He's available to chat-
					Tetron interrupts with a kiss
Wealday morning
	Tetron isn't back yet
		He's on his way back at dawn
		Alistair leaves a note about prepping water breathing
	Alistair knocks on the others' door
		Viola: Where's Tetron?
			He doesn't know
			Alistair can tap his friends to see if they've seen him
				Sure
	Alistair heads towards the nearest safehouse to Liberty (under the assumption that he'd only go to fancy places)
		Luckily, this is in the same direction that Tetron is coming from, so Alistair finds him
		Alistair tells him about the boat and water breathing
			Yeah, give him 10 minutes
	Alistair and Tetron return to the inn
		And off to the boat!
The White Water Spear
	Captain Arnault welcomes us aboard
		She verifies that this is all of us
		When can we leave?
			Viola just needs to be back by Moonday and Tetron by Toilday
			So we're good to go whenever
				Arnault wants to leave ASAP
			We'll be back on Sunday
	Briefing
		A Chelaxian warship that is transporting countless slaves is passing well south of the Missa Shelf peninsula
		Cannot declare war on Cheliax
			Therefore, the objective is to board the cruiser stealthily and rescue as many slaves as possible
		The ship is massive
		Our ship is fast and small
			Will be docked in a rocky area and we'll need to swim out
		Tetron: Reasons other than staying alive to keep quiet?
			Hellknights aboard
			Chelaxian ship is armed to the teeth, so WWS is vulnerable
			However, anything that doesn't break the laws of Andoran are allowed
				And specific regulations for the military can likely be overlooked
		We'll be gone multiple days
			Pack your shit
			No pack animals
		Expect martials and casters
		They can summon creatures from other planes
			Grotesque
			Hellish stuff
			If alarm is sounded, please GTFO
				They can, in an emergency, be a distraction
		Tetron accuses her of using us as the most disposable crew available
			She understands; it's not ideal
			It'd generally only be for military personell or Adept LAPs
				Military has reallocated stuff
			Also, to her and her crew, we are not expendable
		Alistair: Is sinking the ship okay
			Prefer not
			Can break sails, rudder, etc, though
		Someone new walks in
			Nel Moore, the local contact for the Bellflower Network
				Frees slaves in Cheliax
			She greets us
				She was the one who got the intel about the ship
				She can go with us or stay behind and coordinate
	We check out of the inn
We set sail!
	It fast.  Ride is bumpy.
	It's quiet here; crew is professional
		Also, they know that shit will be wild
	There is a night crew
	Oathday now, and we've gone far enough to be well out of sight of land of any kind
	Little bit of storming in the afternoon
	Fireday afternoon, we get close to destination
		Rock outcropping that just sticks out of the water unceremonously
			Alistair looks at it through his spyglass, it's covered in seagulls and bird shit
			There's a small man-made cave thing that the ship slides into
	Arnault notifies us that we're waiting for the Chelaxian ship to pass by in the middle of the night
		Tetron: What's our gameplan to get off the ship?
			Swim
			Viola: What's the gameplan to get non-us people off the ship?
				There's military-only teleportation tech
					We receive the thingy
					Activatable once
					In an area
						Gather folks
					Tetron: We have to give it to Alistair since he'd be the one doing the sneaking
						Viola: Yeah...
		Are we bringing Nel?
		Intel on ship
			Three layers
				Top layer is open air
				Others are interior
				Lowest is where crew and cannons are
					Best chance of stealthy entry in the exact center of the ship
						Need to avoid patrols, though
				Middle layer is where the slaves are, aft
			They don't know everything about all Chelaxian ships
				But there are probably hellknights and traps
				Please have trap-handler in the front
		Also, need less loud clothing
			Viola: If Krug is involved, we're already fucked
			Arnault: I was talking about Viola too
				Viola admits to having no other clothes
				She borrows Zaknos's cloak
		What's our signal for emergency
			Krug: "Bananas bananas bananas"
			Tetron: Ghost sound
			Viola: Prestidigitation
			Tetron: Produce flame into the air as a flare
			Okay, yeah, the flare
	Tetron checks on Goober
		He half-fills the jar now
		Tetron transfers him to a pickle jar
We go to sleep in preparation
	Wake up at 2 AM, nudged by crew
	Planning
		Tetron: What are the most common languages?
			Common, Infernal
			He plans to only be using utility spells
				Does anyone need comprehend languages?
					Maybe Alistair to read signage?
					Maybe for Ventriloquism?
						But Tetron knows Infernal already, and his casting would be better than hers
		Tetron: How is Nilbog?
			A bit hydrophobic
			He does have the life vest
		Viola: Only Krug and Nilbog can seek in the dark
			Tetron gives darkvision to Taranis
		Tetron decides against comprehend languages
	Go time
Approaching the Chelaxian ship
	Tetron: How to get on board?
		No portholes
		There are cannons
			There are at least 30 of them
			We could go in there
			Zaknos: They probably aren't manned right now
		Tetron considers whether there would be openings for cargo or the like in the bottom
			He is intimately familiar with Taldan warships
				There is often a port for waste
				Other countries know that about Taldor
					It's an exploit
					He's not sure if Cheliax would have that design
		What can Nel see?
			Patrols on-deck and folks in crow's nest
				Decent number
			Helm is manned
			Can't see through the cannon ports
				But they are open
		Alistair to go in first, Tetron to cast invisibility
	Ship reaches us
		We grab on
		Alistair prepares to climb up the middle to approach a cannon port
		Surface is smooth metal up 10 feet from the surface of the water
		Tetron has levitate prepared
		Alistair goes up with a rope
		Alistair can fit through a cannon hole that isn't occupied
		Does Alistair see anyone?
			No, but he can hear the echoes of footsteps
				Are they nearby or approaching?
					Two sets sort of close, three farther
						One closer, one farther
			A guard does walk past after a moment
				They're humanoid, heavily armored
				They've got a large polearm
				Once this one passes, but another is coming near after
		Alistair is doubtful that this'll work
		He opens the port to quickly look for hiding spots
			He can see stacked cargo and beams
			Now he sticks his head in to look for other unoccupied ports
				One on the opposite side of the ship, but that's all
			No one visible since he opened the thing
		Alistair can hear quiet conversation at the forward of the ship
		He climbs in but does not secure the rope for now
		He looks for doors for people to hide behind
			Nope, this deck is wide open except forward and aft
		Alistair throws the rope down to Tetron
			Once Tetron's up, Alistair informs him about the bad hiding situation
			Will likely need to go invisible too
		Tetron makes himself invisible
			He intends to go upstairs
			He tells Alistair to levitate around to the back of the ship to look for other access points
		Alistair finds the captain's quarters at the back
			Latched windows
			He looks through and finds no one present
			Door out of the quarters is ajar
			Check for window traps
				Yup
				Is it disablable from the outside?
					He can't tell, let's go
					Success
					Some kind of red thread thing carefully attached
			Alistair enters and attaches the rope
		Tetron inspects the guards
			One at the captain's quarters door
			One at the crew quarters door
			Three walking around the central section
		Tetron moves to the aft stairs
			Stealthy!
			Taking advantage of the rugs
		It's dark upstairs
			That's okay, because Taranis can see
			There is a dude in the crow's nest who would see Tetron if he weren't invisible
			He's standing next to double doors that lead to the aft slave pen
				No one at the door, but there are lots of folks around
				Door is closed
			Tetron looks for points of entry
			Tetron carefully considering the crow's nests
				There are three
					Forward and aft scanning the horizon
					Central keeping watch on the ship itself
				High enough to be unlikely noticed
					For a while
				Tetron heads back down
		Back downstairs
			Whole crew onboard now via capt quarters
			Alistair looks into the port-side adjacent room
				Sleeping quarters
			Alistair looks for traps in the room
				Bookcase is trapped
					It's a pulsing magic sigil
					NOPE
		Tetron comes back down
			He sees the guards he expects to
			Through the ajar door, he catches a glimpse of Nilbog
				Luckily, the guard is facing away from the door
			He messages Nilbog
				Inform of guard near the door
				Is everyone on board
					Yes
				Gives rundown on guards, traps, crows nests
			Tetron sees that we're dripping and tells Nilbog
		Alistair inspects the door to the sleeping quarters
			No traps
			Are the hinges squeaky?
				Look well-maintained
			He peeks in
				Fine room with bed
				Sparse
				No one is within
			Oddly large eye painted on the side of the sleeping quarters
				Is it magic?
					Doesn't look like it, but he's at a weird angle (it's on the same wall he is)
			Nothing of value in here
		Tetron on the stairs
			Messages Nilbog again: crow's nest sleep idea, risky, ask us for feedback
			We decide to use Alistair's head bangle instead
			He comes through the doors
				Sneaks right by the door guard, despite a slightly squeaky floorboard
		Everyone inside
			Tetron looks for images of crew
				Not of captain
				Banners with images of a particularly powerful-looking woman
					It's Abrogail II
			We tell Tetron about the disguise plan
				He has illusory creature, which would give us a second fake guard
			Alistair asks Tetron for help with the trapped bookcase
				Let's take care of the guard first
			How to we snatch a guard?
				Sleep?  Charm?
					Tetron has those as his only 2 4th-level spells
					Can charm to get someone who can help
					Can sleep to throw him overboard
			Zaknos: Could Chimpy help?
				Maybe, have to ask Chimpy
			As we talk, the guard shift changes
			Viola: If we can bop a female guard of my height, that can make 3 fake guards
				Tetron checks guard outside
					Zaknos's height, unknown gender
			Plan: charm, backup sleep
		Execute plan
			Tetron casts the spell, they don't react
				It worked!
			After the patrol moves on, Tetron taps dude on the soldier
				Tetron invites him in
		Talking to Daniel
			He just patrols
			He doesn't ever go upstairs
				Dudes up in the slave area are nuts
			Tetron says that he has a friend up there that he needs to chat with
				Best way in, according to Daniel, is through a metal bit of decoration at the aft
					No traps there
			We quickly get the impression that he crit-failed the save: he's helpful
		Alistair checks the desk for drawers and traps
			Tetron and Krug stop him
		Plan: Nilbog melts through while Krug and Daniel hold him up
			Rug to mask the light from the fire
			Tetron keeps fake Daniel in front of the door to be a slight obstruction to the captain if she returns
			Wall melting completes
		Slave pen
			Large rooms filled with hundreds of slaves, many emaciated or beaten
			Nilbog has one second to calm things
				"I'm one of you."
					Some noise is made by the slaves, but mostly quiet
					And no change in patrol noises
			In the back, protected by magic sigils, are two more pens: the specialty ones
				The glow lights up some of the slaves near them
			Nilbog signals the rest of us come up
				We start to bring Daniel, but Nilbog realizes that that would be a terrible idea
				Tetron tells Daniel to take his post back
				If shit goes wrong, come to the window
				Tetron maintains the illusory creature just in case
			Alistair gets to work
				No traps
				How do we get everyone out of the manacles?
					???
					Not enough range to get everyone in one go
					Might need to have able-bodied folks swim
				All pens opened
			Tetron looks into the traps
				Nilbog helps
				Between their efforts decoding (Nilbog) and erasing (Tetron), first trap disarmed
			Alistair and Tetron work on unlocking magic doors and manacles
				CRIT SUCCESS on doors
				Success on manacles
			Meanwhile, slaves have been organized into able and unable swimmers
			Nilbog gets the teleporter from Alistair
				Zaknos teleports with him and the slaves
		20 slaves with the 4 of us
			Alistair and Tetron go for the captain's quarters
				Desk and Daniel
			Viola and Krug escort the able-bodied slaves out into the water
			Tetron reports to Daniel that "all the slaves jumped out the hole"
				Let's go eat cake
				Daniel goes swimming
					Strips off armor
			Alistair and Tetron go to work on the bookcase
				Large and imposing armor, looks like fancy hellknight armor
					Puts Daniel's armor to shame
					Has magic shit on it
				Large tome
					Source of whispering that they couldn't quite hear until they ope
				Big-ass sword, goes with the armor
				Tetron takes everything (bag of holding)
			Illusory guard greets the captain
				Immediately gets cut down
				Tetron and Alistair are already out the window
				From the office above, they hear awful noises
