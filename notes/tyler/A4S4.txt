Just after battle
	Tetron notices a slight convergence of power moving from the final strike of the combat into Iris's body, and she takes an interestingly deep breath
	Injured folks patched up
	It smells like burnt flesh
	Some folks have gathered around the dead body of Sirran Tahseen
	Namira, with alarm, points toward the exploded body of one of the grad students
	Tetron walks over to where Namira and Cyrus are
		Folks around are pretty shaken up
		Namira is leading effort to get bits of dude into a body bag
			"Do not resusitate" label attached to the bag
				Turns out his family has plans to rez him themselves
		Cyrus is kind of out of it, Nilus comforting him
			Tetron asks if he's okay
				Physically fine
				Aware that divine intervention prevented his death
				Has some stuff to think about
					Needs some time
					Come by later
				Cyrus takes Tetron's hand and puts it on his own chest
					Cyrus's heartbeat feels weird
	Iris rifles through Tahseen's pockets
		In addition to combat gear, his ID, and keys, he's got a small pouch and writing supplies
			Iris was specifically looking for a journal or something, but there isn't one
Next few hours are spent bringing the deceased back up to the surface
	Incident reports
	Tetron has to answer to the dean of the university
	Dorfinn is put back in chains
		Gives Alistair a nod and smile as he's taken away
	Thomas approaches Alistair
		"What are you doing here?"
		Alistair explains that he's with the party
		Thomas is confounded by Alistair stabbing erinyes like it's no big
			He's not even a teen
		Thomas is happy to see Alistair
			He's in the military now
			He thinks that maybe Alistair talking to him isn't great
				He thinks he sold out Dorfinn
			He explains that he had ideas for if Alistair ever came back
				Could have grown stronger and taught him more
				But Alistair has surpassed him
				He's proud of Alistair
			Alistair suggests that Thomas might reach out to the kids at the orphanage
				Could continue Alistair's initiative to find more legit means of the orphans making their way
				Thomas isn't sure
	Grimaldi takes his leave
	Chimpy hasn't exploded yet
		What does he do now?
		Viola: whatever makes you happy
			Cooking, helping Zaknos manage the house, whatever
		Tetron: we do need a way of calling upon you
			Chimpy needs some kind of title for summoning
				"Useful fuck" has been used in the past
				Krug suggests "helpful friend" as an alternative
	Tahseen's body is taken back to the Cerulean Keep
	Iris goes to Viola's room
		Iris asks if Viola would be willing to accompany her to the Cerulean Keep
			Sure, what for?
			Iris caught an interesting comment Tahseen made about her and would like to check his office
		To the Cerulean Keep!
			During a quiet bit, Iris asks about Viola's name change
				Viola explains the incident
				Iris finds it interesting the Viola changed her surname
					To distance herself from her family
					Viola asks why Iris kept hers
						Her family needs to know that their blood is their undoing
			When we get to the keep, we come upon Varuk
				They're ready to head east
					They want to talk to Krug before heading out in the next few days
			Major Zenza approaches us
				Zenza mentions that she heard what happened
					Viola praises his contribution
				Iris asks about Tahseen's files
					Zenza checks files and sees that Iris is allowed access
			We're led to Tahseen's office
				It's immaculate, save for some things knocked over as he hastily left, presumably to catch up with us for the fight
				Zenza pulls out a few files
					First is a recounting of the operation the Radiant Dawn undertook
					Second is a dossier on Abigale Kaulfield specifically
						Contains some details that Iris didn't even know, specifically from after Iris left the family
					Third is in regard to a double assassination in which Abigale had some involvement
						Zenza warns that the details here are classified
				Iris makes copies
				During the copy process, Viola looks around for maps that might be good to add to the Pellsieve
					Viola sees military installaton maps and detailed survey maps
						She doesn't bother, since they'd be too much and kind of a dick move
				Zenza approaches Viola
					She has a job recommendation, but she's hesitant to pass us along because we're probably liable to bungle it
						Because there's a box we're supposed to transport that we aren't allowed to know what's inside
						But the actual objective is to transport an agent to gather intel on Taldor
Fireday evening
	Tetron asks Iris about the energy thing
		Iris explains that her abilities kind of blur the lines between real and unreal
			The energy of the erinyes' hatred and vengeance remains, and she took it into herself
			So now she has cool new shit
		Tetron's interested in that as a source of energy
			Iris definitely believes in the power of spite
				Sees it as a gift from "The Unyielding"
	We get word that Dorfinn's release is in the next few days
	We make it back to SunnySide
		Zaknos has been locating prospective tenants
			He thinks he's done a good job
			They're coming tomorrow
			Tetron asks whether we need to sus them out
				Viola: Do you really think anyone who pays rent would be any more of a danger to the house than Zaknos?
					Good point
			Zaknos goes through the list
				An orc woman, a badger-man knight, a gnome, and a bookkeeper
					Badger and gnome only staying for a few weeks
					Orc and bookkeeper staying longer
				He chose them because they were interestng
				Tetron double-checks to make sure that they are paying rent and that Zaknos isn't giving some kind of discount because he thought they were cool
		Chimpy announces that he wants to learn to make friends
			He asks if that is a job
				Yes, especially as part of managing the house
	Tetron heads over to Cyrus's
		Cyrus is working a large mound of dough
			The ingredients are somewhat simple compared to Cyrus's normal cuisine
			They work together quietly make the dough into noodles
			Ends up as butter pasta with parsley
		Cyrus explains that his mom made it back when she was well
			He made this because he was reminded of something important
				He's been working hard in school, and before that he was working hard to get into school
				He still has his goals, but he's watching a gap grow between his own abiility and Tetron's
					He can't keep up
					He knew that would be a possibility
				It's been too long since he's done something "selfish"
					He knows that Tetron has pressure on him to continue the Hyperius lineage
					He'd like to get stronger, but he'd also like to know whether Tetron sees room on his path for Cyrus to follow
					Tetron asks why Cyrus wants to follow
						If there's any hope in the long-term for Tetron's family to accept him (despite lack of status), he needs to better himself
						And if this is his path, he would want the relationship to be serious
							Tetron takes his hand and gathers his thoughts
							There is an opportunity cost, but he wouldn't be losing anything: Cyrus should do what he wants to, and Tetron supports him, and he's open to having their paths converge and stop bouncing around
		Cyrus says that, with this meal, he sees that this is something he can do long-term
		BOYFRIEND STATUS ACQUIRED
	Viola and Iris call a team meeting
		Viola explains what she knows about the job
		Alistair would totally pry
		Viola and Krug would totally be sus
		We argue for a really long time
		Iris makes the point that Alistair's curiosity could be bought out and that the payment could be enough to do more good than the cargo could do bad to satiate Viola and Krug
	Alistair heads to Tamuth House
		He finds Elwyn
			She tells him that she saw a posting that referenced Alistair by appearance
				Mentions "return of goods"
				The location is Mollick's office at Almas U
Bedtime!
	Cutscene: Meanwhile, thousands of miles away
		Evening, crickets chirping
		In a pillowed waiting room, two individuals sit
			One wearing multiple layers of silk
			The other is holding a checklist
		Clipboard verifies what the other wants: Various sexual acts
			Lump sum of payment is going to one address
		The silk person is new to this
			Clipboard advises: once the doors close, that's it; this is the most important evening of your life; do not attempt to flee
		They walk down a dimly lit hallway
			Clipboard raps on a door
		Inside, standing above, is a large humanoid tiger
			Flowing hair
			Has the look of someone finding their favorite seasonal item at the grocery store
		Fade to black
		After a time, the woman is fully naked
			She lays down on the floor
			A gurney and tray is brought in
			The rakshasa swipes off her thigh in one go and then immediately casts flesh to stone on her
			The thigh is placed on a tray
		The rakshasa then joins Alfric
			Alfric chides him for being late
			Alfric cuts his arm, waves his blood around, conjuring the images of various people
				Sloane, Jericho, Zaknos's dad, and a halfling with a staff
				Sloane looks like she's been travelling
			Jericho starts the meeting
				Sloane reports that the ritual did successfully conclude
					"Not a definite yes, not a definite no"
				Jericho verifies that Sloane didn't manage to eliminate any of the Radiant Dawn
					Sloane reports that her position in Almas and Augustana is compromised and that she's staying where she is for the next month or so
					Jericho says that, luckily, she isn't needed at the Basilica
				Jericho asks whether the Radiant Dawn has contacts outside of Augustana and Almas
					Sloane says yes, especially Taldor
						Jericho says that, given the upcoming festivities, Taldan targets would be undesirable
					Jericho says that there should be one or two warning shots
						Powerful enough where their death would be impactful
				Jericho asks how Archimandrite Zahir Gomim is doing
					A woman apporaches Gomim and he says that she is ready for "the lake"
				Jericho asks whether "his children" are accounted for
					Sloane responds in the affirmative
Starday morning
	Tetron's back
		Krug was worried that Tetron was in trouble with the school
			No, this shit happens
		Alistair tells Tetron that Mollick wanted to see him
			Could Tetron come?
				Sure
	Zaknos hosts the incoming tenants for a meet and greet
		We don't stick around
	We head to the university first
		A ruckus as multiple people are packing things
			Mollick is among them
			One of the people helping tells us that Mollick isn't seeing grad students right now
				Tetron is flattered that the person thinks he looks like a grad student
					Viola also says that she's flattered for the same reason
				Alistair mentions the ad
					Mollick brings him in and hands him a note, claiming it to be a rejection letter for his "sibling", and then we're quickly shoved back out
			Tetron asks about Mollick's departure
				The helper says that Mollick is suffering from a condition
				Mollick says that he's bleaching
				Tetron wants to know where he's going
					Mollick pretends to not know him
					Tetron messages him instead
						Mollick says that he's being monitored and has to leave, as he's being called and has no intention of answering it
						Tetron offers aid, but Mollick says that, unless he can kill a rakshasa, no dice
						Rakshasa's known as Otherid'Noq, the Flippaw Father
							Located in Oppara
					Tetron notices on Mollick's lapel a small pin, and then Mollick "accidentally" knocks it onto the floor
		Alistair looks through the envelope in the light
			It's a sketch of a handful of individuals
			They're named (but I missed them)
			He says that this might be more for all of us
	To the IMG office!
		Viola requests a membership change
			Add Iris
				Tetron: Does Iris require re-trial?
					In her case, no, because of prior military eval
			Put Zaknos and Nilbog on inactive status
		Clerk asks if we're interested in tackling Adept LAP
			We'll think on it
	To the Cerulean Keep
		Tetron is only just now being told
		Meeting with Zenza
			She asks whether we've made a decision
				Not yet, we'd like more info
			Who's the client?
				Prominent Andoren family, can't specify
					Would compromise the identity of the agent
					There have been incidents where Andoren intelligence is being closely monitored
				How much is the pay?
					Flexible
					Could be a great deal
				Where are we going?
					To Cassomir (specifically the Taldan side)
				Zenza prefers that we take stuff we're comfortable with
				Zenza does share our concerns about the box
					However, this kind of shipment is done yearly
					No issues thus far
					In the past, though, this was done by the family's personal mercs
						This is the first time outside help has been tapped
				Tetron pulls us all aside to make a decision
					Tetron argues that knowing all this means that if something bad does happen, we can do something about it
					Fair
					Iris pokes her head out to ask when they want to depart
						Within a week
					Tetron proposes accepting the quest and then arranging a meeting tomorrow
				We accept
					Zenza gives us the address
						It's the Maceras
					Zenza will schedule the meeting for us
						Sun-up tomorrow
	Back to Sunny-Side for further discussion
		The meet-and-greet is over
		Alistair opens up the envelope and shows it to Tetron
			Alistair says that he couldn't find any hidden message
			Tetron considers that Mollick and perhaps the tiefling druid would be the only ones who could live that long
			Tetron asks to keep it
			For a brief moment, Tetron finds himself in a liminal space again
				He's in the staff
				Mirror Tetron asks if the wizard depicted is Tetron's kin
					Yes
				What does Mirror Tetron care about Tetron's lineage?
					Claims to want to know everything, it's a foreign concept
				Tetron asks whether Mirror Tetron can see what he see when he "looks back on his family history"
					Claims to not see it yet
					Tetron notices the "yet"
				Tetron asks if Mirror Tetron still finds the arrangement agreeable
					Yes
					Mirror Tetron says that Tetron should also still find it agreeable, being that more power is available: MAJOR GIFT 1
			Tetron says that he doesn't see a cypher either
				He reveals the whole rakshasa situation
				He thinks it odd that we've come across two rakshasa situations
					Could be the same one?
					He asks what we make of the pin, showing it to us
						Viola recognizes the symbol from the curse immediately
						"Tetron, look at things!"
		Tetron turns the topic to the job
			We argue more
			Alistair asks to leave
				Viola calls him out on going to go gather info on the Maceras
					He doesn't deny it
				We argue more until he leaves
			We argue more
		Iris says she has a friend to go meet
			A regular friend, not a sexual encounter or a shady figure, as we clarify
Alistair goes out
	To Tamuth House!
		He tells Elwyn that it's the Maceras - be careful
		He asks where Stareye is
			Liberty District, waiting for Dorfinn's release this evening
	To Liberty District!
		He finds Stareye watching the lengthy outprocessing for Dorfinn
		Alistair asks to chat privately
			He tells Stareye about the Macera mission
			He asks if he knows anything about the box or the family in general
				Every year at Gillmen's Moor, there's a whole rigamarole around getting this box loaded and out of the city
					It's heavy as fuck, requiring dedicated cranes
				Last year's escorts were killed
					Container was not compromised, so emergency interceptors were able to secure it
				Where does the box come from?
					Not seen entering Almas, so it must be a local source
				When the box was tampered with, there was some kind of suction sound, based on various accounts
		Alistair waits with Stareye
Iris and others go out
	We arrive at the Park
	Iris spots the person she's looking for
		A person in a green cloak wearing bandages all over their face
		Looks like they're groundskeeping
		Iris greets them
			They have a package for Patia in Cassomir
			The person's voice sounds mangled
			Iris knows that they're from Cur's Tooth
		We're led through an embalming chamber and arrive at a cubby, where the person pulls out a pouch that is tightly closed
			It contains material to help people with her condition
				Dread wraith robe scraps
					Dread wraiths are the spiritual remnants of particularly wicked people
					Value of the cloth: that incorporeality can be distilled for ethereal prostheses
					Primarily harvested in Nidal and Cheliax
			DO NOT OPEN THE BAG UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
		They complement the condition of Iris's prosthetic
	Tetron compliments Iris's charity work
		Asks about the history there
			This individual and their associates ferried her out of Cheliax
		What about the arm?
			That came later
