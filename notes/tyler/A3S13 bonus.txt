A3S13 bonus

Starday pre-dawn
	Zaknos, Nilbog, and freed slaves appear in an unknown location
		Their feet hit the hard floor
		As if this was expected, people start handing out towels, water, food, and clothes to the slaves
		Slaves are confused as hell
	One of the VIP slaves approaches Nilbog
		He looks like a penguin
		Nilbog basically walks straight past him out the door
	Nilbog outside
		He sees that he's no longer on or even near the ship
		Coast, fishing village
	The other VIP approaches Zaknos
		Small brown-haired halfling wearing tattered servant clothes
		He thanks Zaknos for the help
		He asks which government he's with
			Zaknos: Still TBD
				Need to figure out where we are
				Nilbog went to go look
		He introduces himself as Tate van Lew
			Former servant to someone in Taldor
		Asks for Zaknos's name and gets it
		Tries to introduce the penguin, but he's already followed Nilbog out
		He heard some conversation that there would be a cart going back to town
		He offers to give info as thanks
			That info was what got him arrested and shipped toward Cheliax
			Looking to set himself up in Andoran
		Zaknos tells him to meet upstairs later after he cleans up
			Maybe gather some people he knows to chat?
				Just him and the penguin
		He goes to get his wounds treated
	Zaknos asks around as to what's going on
		This is a secret holding area in the bottom of a gov't facility in Claes
		Whenever Andoran encounters a slave vessel, they use the teleport stone to send the freed slaves here
			Less frequent nowadays since Andoran and Cheliax have gone from war to merely very tense
			Also, due to darkwood shortage, Andoren naval ships are basically non-expendable
	Looking around, Zaknos can tell that many of the freed slaves aren't even going to bother heading back to the city
	Zaknos goes outside
		He finds Nilbog holding some biscuits
		He notices that this is the first time that he's truly separated from Krug
			Especially since everyone else is stuck back in the fight
		Zaknos greets Nilbog
			Nilbog: It'll take more biscuits to make this a good situation
			Nilbog breaks off half a biscuit to share
		Zaknos: This is hard for me too
		Nilbog: How much do you think everyone (that got teleported) weighed (in total)?
			There were 250 slaves, though they were largely emaciated
			Zaknos: Probably like 1,000 lbs
			Nilbog: Do you know much about boats?
				Zaknos: No.
			Nilbog: Do you think the guards would have noticed all that weight disappearing?
				Zaknos: Yeah, probably.
				That's bad
				Nilbog: So they're in danger, huh?
				And they know that they're nowhere near the others
					Shit
	Some time passes, freed slaves continue to get treated
		Zaknos and Nilbog decide to sleep while that happens
			Zaknos: Let's find a cheap place to stay
			As they explore, the town is weirdly fortified
Starday, morning
	Someone from the relief effort informs them that the wagon convoy is forming
		Zaknos: Is everyone accounted for?
			Yes
			Most folks aren't going
				Instead spreading out into the nearby farmland
			Only 10 freed slaves (inc Tate and the penguin) going on the wagons
	Breakfast, then hopping on the wagon
Wagon trip
	They're loaded in with Tate, the penguin, and one other guy
	Zaknos takes in the unusualness of the penguin
		An avian creature loaded with cold-weather gear
		Dude looks a lot happier than Tate
		Enjoying the sun on his feathers
	The penguin introduces himself to Zaknos
		Extends a flipper
		Introduces himself as Dumont d'Urville, explorer of the frozen wilds
		He's happy to hear that Zaknos is also an adventurer
		How'd Zaknos get on the ship?
			Expresses appreciation for his rescue
			Zaknos explains that we're part of a bigger party
				The Radiant Dawn
				We came to rescue
				Dumont: Wonderfully fortuituous
		Dumont says that he's ever indebted to us
			He offers services in regards to exploring the high north
				Especially LoMaV
		Dumont had been hired by a professor in Andoran to explore the north
			But he got tricked and trapped along the way
			Complains about having gotten too dry
		Zaknos looks him over
			Looks like he's an explorer and a tracker
				He gets the impression that his beak and talons are sharpened in case of a fight, but not as strong as us
			Says that he might have a decent amount to learn from him about the north
	More casual conversation
		Dumont is a particular variety of tengu (wavediver)
		Dumont was hired by Felix Savaxis
			Was returning to Andoran when he was captured
		Tate was a butler for a House in Taldor
			His employer was Alfric Kavrus
				Related to Sloane?
					Had previously heard that Sloane was a bastard child
				Tate was cleaning Alfric's study when he came across documents relating to odd goings-on
					The source of the family's financial discrepancy
					When Tate reported that to his supervisor, he was scooped up and sent to Cheliax
				Also, House Kavrus is gathering a bunch of money to finance the art show in Oppara
	Ride is relatively peaceful
		Sloane was born to a consort of the house and yeeted to Galt
		Tate's demeanor improves
			He speaks to Zaknos and Nilbog quietly
				Given what we know about Sloane, he offers some info
				Demanding, cruel, but plied by two things
					Good red wine, only drinks red wine
					He's also into handsome men
				No drugs, gambling, doesn't drink to excess
				Definitely a man of high society
				The family values events that are good for networking
					That's why they're donating so much to the event
				Tate asks whether our intention is to destroy the Coaltion
					Zaknos looks to Nilbog to see if he's fine with telling
					Nilbog looks back with a slight stank face
					Answer: Nowhere is necessarily safe, so can't really give an answer
						Shared understanding about the deliberate non-answer
		Future plans
			Tate is looking to find work in Almas
			Dumont is going to report back to Savaxis and then head back north
				Dumont: That'll be the last time someone gets me with sardines!
					It'll take at least a salmon!
	Last call for questions
		Nope
Arriving in Almas, Sunday evening
	They arrive an hour before the Whitewater Spear
	They chill in the lobby of the Birch Branch
	When the rest of the party arrives, they look rough
		Basically just catch up and go to bed
Moonday morning
	Everyone else is just doing their own thing
	Amos drops by
		He says that he's received an exit window from his organization
			Note about Amos's work: he is connected to artisans, he comes and buys the piece and then brings it to the buyer
			He's been in town waiting for people to finish their work and other goods to come down the river
			He asks again whether the Radiant Dawn would be interested in coming with the Olgirs overland to the Taldan border
			His planned departure date is Moonday the 21st
				Slightly flexible, though
			Zaknos does know about Viola's desire to pass through Cassomir at some point
			Please talk about it with others
		Real reason he's here: he wants to take Alice and Fleche out for the afternoon and would like Zaknos to come along
			It's been a rough schedule managing business deals and stuff
			But it's a beautiful day today
			Wants to visit a small Desnan shrine and also visit an aviary
				Fleche has the owl (Borgan), and he's nice and all, but he's nocturnal
					She's been wanting to make a little something for him
	Amos and Zaknos head over to the Desnan shrine
		It's just tucked between a few houses next to a tree
		Amos says a little prayer
		Amos mentions that he has a bit of cleric training
			Desna worship is common among merchants
			If we ever encounter issues on the road, Amos can help
				Detect magic, stabilize, prestidigitation, dancing lights, message
				He knows that it's not very impressive, but it's something
					"I'm only mostly helpless"
		The shrine has something of a Bohemian vibe
		Off to fetch Fleche and Alice
	Picking up Fleche and Alice
		Alice is holding a pissed-looking Borgan in a cage
		Fleche is stoked
	To the aviary
		It's in the Liberty District, toward the north
		It's kind of like a greenhouse filled with all sort of birds
			Some common, some exotic
			Super lush
		Borgan is shrieking and banging around, pissed at all the other birds
			Amos: Nah, we can't let him out - he'd fight everything
		Smells like mondo birdshit
		Employees hand out sacks of feed for folks to use
			Fleche has a good time with that
			Zaknos takes some too
			Have to keep your hand flat; cupping it will get the birds to peck too hard
			The birds are weirdly fluffy up close
		Also there's a teahouse
			Borgan even gets fed some crackers
		And a special area with birds of prey
			Can pet some of the hawks
			Borgan is losing his shit at there being other owls
		At the end, there's a crafting area
			Apparently was Amos's favorite part when younger
			Amos pays extra to receive more materials
				Two blocks of soft wood
					He hands a long one to Alice
					Keeps a squat one to work on together with Zaknos
			This is the real reason we're here
				Borgan has done a number on his cage
				Alice and Fleche are making a bird feeder
					Amos, quietly: This will entertain Fleche forever
				Zaknos and Amos are making a new cage for Borgan
					This takes a few hours
					It comes out nicer than the old one
		While working, Amos turns to Zaknos
			Wants to explain something
			He feels that people are different
				Like the birds, where the birds of prey have to be kept from the general population
				We need people who are bird feeders and others who are bird cages
			Amos feels separate from society
				And he's okay with that
				Even if it is lonely
			Without the cages, the smaller ones can be picked off
			What he means to say is this
				He thinks its wonderful that some people are able to chart their own paths in life
				Folks who don't need a deity, do what they choose
				But for him, religion changed his life for the better
				Before he was in the faith, he was fine, but he feels like he's become more than he could have been
					He's not trying to convert Zaknos
				He feels like he has a greater purpose to further
				He wants Zaknos to know that however much he lives for what he believes in, he also lives for those he loves
					Which can cause conflict
					But no matter what, he'll always love his family, and he'll always love Zaknos
					Warning: if we find Zaknos's dad, he may not be able to choose friendship
					Maybe Zaknos'll have to make those kinds of choices
						Between friends and mother, for example
						He would understand if he has to choose between friends and Amos and then chooses friends
						He takes Zaknos's hand and tells him that he'll always care for him
		Once the new cage is finished, Borgan jumps right in
			As for the bird feeder, Fleche piloted the design... and it's a disaster
				But Amos still humors her
		Fleche thanks Zaknos for hanging out with her
			Especially feeding the birds together
		Amos continues his metaphor
			He's not sure whether Fleche is a bird for a feeder or a cage
			Does Zaknos believe that fate pilots what he does?
				I dunno... sure
				Amos admits to having no idea what he was doing with his life in his 20s
					He compliments Zaknos on being ahead of him in that regard
						Zaknos says that getting help from others has really propelled him
			Who is the closest to Zaknos in the party?
				Nilbog
		Amos says that he'll call in the morning to hand the "bird feeder"
	They go out for arepas
		Fleche realizes that chicken the meat and chicken the bird are the same thing
