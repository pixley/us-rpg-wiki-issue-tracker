Flash forward a day and a half
	Godsrain
Sunday Evening
	Kaulfields' planar palace
		Tetron disintegrates Iris's parents' bodies
		We're catching our breath after the fight
			Tetron goes to heal Viola, exhausting his staff
			Patia pops a squat
			Sloane slides down to the floor, leaning against a chest
		Looting the bodies
			Loads of stuff
		Tetron poofs back into a centaur
			So now he has to squeeze around
		Tetron takes a look around the garden area below Eligor's bath
			Most of the plants here are toxic
		Iris wonders whether the planar palace is persistent or is reset daily
			Tetron knows that it has to be cast daily
			Presumably, the Kaulfields have some item to hold the spell
		Iris asks Krug to move the bodies to the courtyard
		Iris goes upstairs
			She enters a study
				The room contains mounted creature heads, esoterica, a desk with documents, and incense
					Incense is the same smell as that at the Bains' hoard
				There's a metal door at the other side of the room
					It has a warning emblazoned upon it
					There is also no handle, but there are indentations
					She gives it a look to see if it's trapped
						Nope
					She puts her hands into the indentations, saying "Fuck it, I'm a Kaulfield"
						She has to push pretty hard to get it open
						Blood is drawn from Iris's real hand, but it seems to be accepted, and the door opens without issue
			The room beyond is just two chairs facing a curtain
				She pulls the curtain aside, reveal a painting
					It is a portrait of Abrogail Thrune II, nearly lifelike
						The background elements sway in a breeze
				She puts it all together
					This is a space in which the Kaulfields can contact the Infernal Magistrix, a sanctum for those closest to the throne
						Specifically, one can step through to go straight to the Chelaxian throne room
				Iris moves on to the next room
					It's a small space with a fine desk
					There's a small box on a table to the left, and a larger box atop a chest to the right
					There's a missive on the desk
						Invasion plans: Cheliax against Andoran
							Two-pronged assault
								Cheliax over the mountains
								Plants in Galt from the other direction, and also large groups of sleeper agents in major cities
							Mihail Awidi listed as a person of interest, as he had been working against these sleeper agents in Augustana
					Small box
						Acrid liquid, dark
						Ashes
						Iris doesn't know what these are
					Large box
						Music box
						Half-burned candles, black and red and inscribed
					Iris shoops everything into her spacious pouch
		Iris comes back downstairs
			She checks on Patia and Sloane
				Patia is reattaching her cannon after blowing it out during the fight
					She asks how Iris feels
						Empty, unfulfilled, frustrated, catharsis
						Can't place one emotion in particular
					Patia is encouraging
						Not much else here to threaten us
						Can process later
				Sloane has healed a bit
					She raises her arm to be helped up
						Iris obliges
					"I assume this is your home"
						A simulacrum, yes
						Still has the master bedroom and basement to sweep
							Sloane asks if they should look together
								Sure
							Anything she shouldn't see?
								No
			She finds Viola in the dining room
				This fight wasn't just for vengeance
				She drops the war plans on the table in front of Viola
					Viola is stunned and calls Tetron over
						Tetron's busy with pruning herbs, and he's a bik boi again
		Iris goes back upstairs, Sloane and Alistair in tow
			They come upon a meeting space
				A gift-wrapped box sits upon the table
					It's addressed to a location in Augustana
					Alistair checks it for traps
						It has a minor mechanism
					Inside is the bare skull of a catfolk
						Chester
				Nothing else in the room of interest, save for a large reinforced tome
					It's in diabolic - an address book for Chelaxian nobles
						It's property of House Thrune
						Iris checks it for a tracking rune
							Nope, though it is labelled for time-limited borrowing
			Master bedroom time
				Weapon rack, with Eligor's falcata lying upon the bed
					Alistair uses the spacious pouch trick to check whether the weapons are real
						He gets three common runes of our level out of the deal
		Back downstairs
			Iris and co investigate a small sitting room and find a secret door behind a bookcase
		Into the basement
			Three more metal blood-checking doors
				She explains the doors to the others
			Door number 1
				Alchemical lab
				There are documents featuring Iris's deadname, but they're technical
					She grabs them for Krug and/or Tetron to analyze
				Next to the documents, there's a glass dome incubating a scaled fetal creature with black hair
					It's dead, though
				Alistair runs the technical docs up to Tetron
					"There's a creepy baby thing downstairs, and it's somehow related to Iris."
					The docs are in multiple languages, but Tetron knows all of them
					He peruses the documents
						He realizes why the Kaulfields and Bains were working together
						The Kaulfields' plan was to capture Iris, place her in a chamber, break her physically and emotionally, then mutate her into a living weapon
							Her existing physique is listed as a failure
						Kyphon's experiments are detailed
							He used to be less compliant
						Techniques include bone grafting and usage of a time fey
						Details of Iris's upbringing
							For her privacy, he requests that no one else reads this
						They had considered doing this stuff with Abigale, but they decided against it
							No reason listed
						Cultivating enough secondary materials to conduct the work
						Multiple test homunculi in multiple stages of gestation
						The techniques are possible even if the subject has already deceased
			Door number 2
				Sloane stops Iris from opening the door, pointing out blood already in the door
					Alistair proposes draining it, but he can't figure out how
					Sloane hypothesizes that it's pulling blood from something beyond
			Door number 3
				It's a recreation of Iris's childhood room, but coated in an arcane miasma
					Alistair runs to go get Tetron
						Tetron squeezes his way down the halls and stairs
				Tetron looks over the miasma, considers what he read, and determines this to be a holding cell
					The flow of time here is altered
						Extremely slow
					There is also a small holding pen for a tiny creature
						This would be where the time fey would go
				Tetron turns around and tells Iris that the room is a trap
					But he'll tell her more later
			Back to door number 2
				Tetron takes a look and just prestidigitates the blood away
				Inside lies a ritual sacrifice
					Ram skull
					Empty plate
					Bowl of tar
					Empty plate
					Burning plate of blood
					Dead sheep in the middle
					Runes drawn in blood on the floor
				Empty plates should have something placed upon them
				Tetron and Iris consider what the effect would have been
					Iris realizes that this was a summoning ritual
						The last two items would have to be related to the individual entity being summoned
				There's a book on a table at the far end of the room
					Alistair fetches it for Tetron
						It's a prayer book
							It indicates which creatures could be summoned, and the materials are all here, since the Kaulfields consort with devils
		We've been in every room at this point, so time for the final sweep
			Planar key
				It's a foot-wide disk
				It does require the investment of a 7th-rank spell slot
			A gilded wooden box
				Extremely heavy
				It's locked
					Alistair gives it a once-over
					Picked open
					It's loaded with gold
					But also a small card atop the pile, black, red, and diabolic
						It has the House Thrune crest upon it
						And it's magic
							Tetron analyzes it and discovers its purpose: it's a blank check to be used to purchase the time fey
								And it vanishes upon use
								It's keyed to approved houses, so Iris would need to be the one to use it
					The gold amounts to 9.5k
		Viola finally presents the war plans and addres book to Tetron
			Tetron considers the value of handing these over to Eutropia instead
				It would be an amazing intel dump, but what use it would be depends on Eutropia's leanings towards the other two nations
					And a copy wouldn't have any weight
			Timeline is for the invasion to begin in three months
				A mountain crossing in the middle of winter?!
			Iris asks for the missive back once Tetron's done reading it
				She wants to make sure that it's used for the correct purposes
					Tetron insists that he is dedicated to maintaining the stability of the world
		Tetron asks what we should do about the bodies
			Viola: wrap them in bedding and hand them over to Buracir's troops outside
		Tetron reallocates a spell slot for sending
	Back outside
		Andoren guard posted outside
			She calls for a team to clear the interior and cordon off the entrance
				They don't enter the blood doored rooms for their own safety
		It's 11 pm by the time we're done debriefing
			We mention Chester's skull and that we intend to deliver it to Zenza in Almas
				The medic on hand mentions that this may be enough to rez him
	On the way back to the Black Pit Tavern
		Tetron: plans for tomorrow?
			Iris and Tetron at the auction, and the others present the evidence against Cheliff
			And then we come back together to port to Almas
		Tetron requests to wait to hand over the war stuff until he stops being a centaur
			Viola and Iris protest, saying that this should be handed over ASAP
			Could he just prep a ton of humanoid form spells?
				He doesn't know the spell, but he can learn it
		What are Patia and Sloane doing now?
			Patia's going to report back to Hosetter, now that she no longer needs the active protection
			Sloane needs to be at the auction house well in four hours, so she's going home, clean up, and get some sleep
				Iris pulls her aside to thank her
				She says that she won't be available to talk during the auction
					She acknowledges the black card and that it could draw unwanted attention
						She volunteers to coordinate with the head auctioneer to make the purchase private instead
						She shows Iris a signal to indicate that she should just bid normally
				Iris: Is Tetron's physiology going to be an issue
					Other than his pride, no
				She asks Iris to come find her some time in the next few days
					She has some thoughts about the night's events and some things that could help
					Sure, over drinks
		Tetron casts sending to Martella
			"I have proof that Cheliax will wage war on Andoran from without and within in next three months.  Andorens may learn this tomorrow.  Advise."
			Response: "Received.  Good looking out.  I will hold a private council with Eutropia tonight.  In what fashion did you come across this?  If it's illegal, that's fine, just let me know."
			Tetron drains bonded item from Borgon to reply: "Chelaxian agents, Kaulfield, possess missive of war.  Found in course of working Cassomir with Andoren permission.  When to expect response?"
			Response 2: "Arranging meeting with Eutropia now.  Expect response by 6 AM or later.  This corresponds with intelligence we have received, but not verified."
			Issue: Main auction space is magic-proofed
				Silent auction may not be in that room, but spell casting could still be faux pas
				But the silent auction runs for a time, so he doesn't need to be cut off right at 6 AM
		Iris: Do we even need to bother with the silent auction?
			Viola: Type 4 spacious pouches are valuable, and they have more stuff
			There is an opportunity cost, though
				Except Krug has over 5k!!!
	Back at the Black Pit Tavern
		Divvying up loot
		Tetron identifies the three items that we don't recognize
			Candles are Grave Candles (4)
			Other two fail
Bedtime!
8 AM, Sunday
	We go to liquidate the loot from the Kaulfields
	And purchase 2k worth of diamond
		Krug given custodianship
	At 4:45 AM, Tetron receives a sending
		The voice of an old woman he does not know: "Thank you for bringing your given intelligence to our attention.  I believe that this will be a great boon to the empire.  Eutropia wishes to extend the following to you..."
		Five fine cards appear in Tetron's hands
			Councilor Rashidi Adeoye has ordered an audience be granted to the members of the Radiant Dawn
				Tetron has heard the name: she is a long-serving councilor, the only female to hold the post for a long time
					She is considered to have great influence in the imperial palace
	Tetron sends to Martella
		He reports the summons from Adeoye.  Should she be trusted?  What do I need to know?
		Response: "Council Adeoye is a powerful, wise, and respected member of Eutropia's cabinet.  She's a shrewd and wise woman, to be treated with great respect.  I trust her as I trust myself."
It's like noon now
	Time to pool our auction gold
		Tetron's plan is to portion out leftover proportionally
		25k in the pool, with even contributions
	Tetron and Iris walk into the Roaring Hall, which is being used as the silent action space
		The others have briefly accompanied them
		All tables and chairs have been stowed
		The crowd is massive
		The three spacious pouches are in a prominent location
			One is drawing particular attention, on account of its markings, as they seem to be a crest
				Alistair pegs it as the symbol of a prominent thieves' guild leader in Oppara
			A non-Opparan noble house crest adorns another
			The third bag is without iconography, but the drawstrings are stained with fine paints
			They decide to leave them be
		Other wares
			Slaves, artwork, historical items, other things not relevant to adventurers
		Alistair notices several people in plain clothes, casing the patrons for potential pickpocketing
			Alistair's watchful eye gives guard for the others
		Iris notices someone looking at the party before ducking away as she looks up
			The person looks sewn together
			He smiled at them
		Krug sees someone taking notes, observing a couple looking at the slave lots
		Tetron rejoins Iris and suggests that the pouches are worth a second look, with everything else being irrelevant
			The starting bid for each was 2500 gp
			Four bids for bag 1 - noble
			Nine bids for bag 2 - thief
			Two bids for bag 3 - painter
			Tetron takes a closer look at the painter's bag
				There aren't a lot of artists who use divine magic in their pain, so this must belong to a late master artist, a disciple of Shelyn
					Portrature painted with a glaive
			Alistair thinks about the thief thing
				Before a person named Brassjaw took over the Folds (slum), there was a half-orc woman who ran the area.  Her lieutenant was the former owner of this bag.
					Dude was a gambler, so the interest in the bag may be accounted for by there being a crap ton of money in it, plus likely luck-cheating magical items
			Alistair declares his intent to get a sneaky peek at the auction master's clipboard with the bids
				Use a dummy bid to have the auction master flip through to bag 2, gain info on bag 1 bids
					If the bag 1 bids are too high, we go 3k on bag 3
				Tetron puts forward a sure-loss bid of 2800, then puts on an act about not being confident in bidding
				Alistair catches that bag 2 has a gambler's staff and a lucky coin, both powerful items
					Current highest bid is 4300
				For bag 1, it belonged to a now-extinct noble house - [something] palace, desolation thingy, and personal effects
					Current highest bid is 3200
				Alistair relays the info to Tetron, who then swaps his bid to 3500 for bag 1
				Krug and Alistair decide to pool more money to big on bag 3
					3k
		From above, Sloane signals to Iris that it's time to enter the main auction chamber
			She and Tetron head that way
	Entering the carved chamber
		Tetron feels the distinct sensation of magic being nullified as he enters
		There isn't space for Iris and Tetron to be seated together
		At the front of the chamber stand Sloane, Gaultier, Tsavo the pet merchant, and two others
