-----

Oathday, early afternoon
	Just opened the door under Greyguard Castle
	Squarish room within, with four figures inside
		Constable Cheliff
		Sloane, standing in front of a glass case
		Short humanoid male we don't recognize
			He was already looking at the door
			Reaching out toward something
		Amos at the very center of the room
			Krug and Alistair can see his physical being, A-posing above the floor
				Certain bits of his flesh pinched, looks like that's what's anchoring him
			Tetron, Viola, and Krug can see his spirit
				Krug can see the strands pinching at him, which descend into and beyond the floor
			Tetron and Viola can see thin threads extending to someplace else
			He's essentially being made and unmade continuously
		Outer ring with a sunken central area
			The floor around the outside is an odd metal, polished
			Celestial patterns undulating on the lower floor
		Tetron, Viola, and Alistair can see a snare at the bottom of the stairs
	Viola: "Doing some mortal experimenting, are we?"
	Cheliff smiles, looks to her right, and steps aside
		And a door we can't see opens
			We can hear people within
			An old man steps out
				"I heard a voice.  I'm coming out."
	The man walks over to our side of the room
		"You find us in an interesting situation."
			Viola: "Do you not know who we are?"
			Tetron: "We're just here to pick up our friend."
				He says Amos is indesposed
		He acknowledges our disruption of our plans
			But he claims that he has no personal issue with us
	Iris: could we come down the stairs, though?
		Sloane comes over and gathers the trap
	Two other figures come through the door the old man came through
		A halfling and a rough-looking tiefling, both male
			The halfling was previously seen by Krug and Nilbog beneath Almas
			The tiefling looks kind of like Felix
	Everyone other than the party assembles in the depression
	The old man introduces himself as Jericho Isarn
		He cautions against physically interacting with Amos at this point
		He assures us that Alice and Fleche are safe
			They no longer have need of them
		He says that we need not fight and could come to some agreement
		He, the short guy who was already in the room, and the two people who followed him out are apparently leaving soon
			Viola: Our gripe with you is about hurting innocent people
				He offers regret about that
	Tetron: Is what you're doing to Amos merely payback, or does it have an actual purpose?
		Jericho says that Amos was one of his closest friends, and an important visionary within the Coalition
		Jericho still wanted to allow Amos to contribute to the goal he wanted: alleviating the human condition
			Learning important things
			Tetron is angling at the possibility of a trade
				Can this be undone?
					Possible, but extremely difficult for most mortals
				Tetron says he knows the location of something they want, claiming we were heading toward its location
					"Does this mean anything to you?  Faith, true-sight, loyalty"
					Jericho acknowledges this as an Arodenite slogan
					Tetron claims that we're tracking a brooch and offers its location rather than us pursuing it
						Jericho takes a moment to consider this, closing his eyes
							The floor magic shit responds to his consideration, and he levitates
						Jericho says this is a kind offer, but the things in the cases Sloane was initially standing next to
							The seamstresses we employed are extremely difficult to contact
							However, Jericho says Amos is not dying or in danger
	Jericho makes an offer: the Radiant Dawn steps away and the Coalition stops harming people
		Viola: If your cause is so noble, why did it take us (whom you made) for you to decide to change?
			Non-answer, instead talking about Fleche no longer believed to be relevant to the prophecy and that we might be instead
		Viola: Okay, but what about the tiefling?  He doesn't seem to be doing so hot.
			Sure.
		Iris gets impatient and just tells Jericho to leave
			He and the two who came out with him port away
	Sloane: So, we fighting now?
		Iris: I have no issue with you, since we haven't met.  If we're the last two standing, want to just walk away?
			Bet
		Viola: So, how's life treating you?
			roll initiative
INITIATIVE
	Round 1
		Cheliff approaches Iris, whiffs a hammer swing against her, then raises her shield
		Iris exploits weakness against Cheliff and gets personal antithesis, uses her mirror, then misses a stab at Cheliff
		Alistair uses his ring of the ram against the halfling, but he resists
		Sloane moves to flank Iris, analyzes her movement, then whiffs a stab
		Tetron casts chain lightning, hitting the halfling, Sloane, and Cheliff (fail, fail, crit fail), then follows up with a lightning bolt against Cheliff
		The halfling casts globe of invulnerability, then speaks
			"I will obliterate Amos if you continue to do this."
		Viola takes her duelling pose, fails to discern whether the aura around Amos is dangerous, and then moves to support Iris against Sloane and Cheliff
		Krug charges into the halfling (CRIT), then fails to shove the halfling out of the sphere
		Iris and Viola hear a faint thumping from the door Jericho didn't come through
	Round 2
		Cheliff attempts to take out a potion, but Iris uses the opening to stab her, interrupting, then actually takes it out and chugs it
		Iris intensifies Cheliff's vulnerability, then misses two stabs
		Alistair moves to flank the halfling with Krug, then spellstrikes (CRIT)
			Off-guard, 14 persistent bleed, 1d10 persistent fire
		Sloane shifts to flank Viola with Cheliff, then stabs at her twice (hit but glimpsed, hit)
		Tetron casts chain lightning against Cheliff, Sloane, and the halfling (successfully piercing the globe) (fail, fail, fail)
			The halfling dies to the chain lighting
		Viola feints then stabs Sloane with a nonlethal blow, then steps away from Sloane to get out of the flank
		Krug moves between Sloane and Cheliff, swings at Cheliff (miss), then raises his shield
		More thumping
	Round 3
		Cheliff offers to surrender, then moves to take out a potion but Iris stabs with the opening, killing her
			Stab through the mouth
		Iris goads Sloane, moves to flank her with Krug, then stabs her (hit)
			Sloane is frightened 1
		Alistair moves to flank Sloane with Iris, stabs her nonlethally (hit)
			Sloane is unconscious
		Tetron steps over and DOESN'T cast lightning bolt
Combat over
	Tetron and Iris argue over leaving Sloane alive
	Viola, Iris, and Krug rush over to open the banging door
		Alice and Fleche are tied up and gagged
			Cut them loose
			Iris dips
		Alice throws her arms around Krug and starts rambling out an explanation to the situation
		Alice has taken some damage, but Fleche is unharmed
		Fleche explains that there was some kind of sermon to ascertain whether she was compatible with their plans, but she "did bad"
			Alice clarifies that Fleche turned out to not be a fit
		Viola warns them about Amos's situation
		Alice carries Fleche to shield her from the horror
	Iris and Tetron approach the glass display cases
		The items are displayed almost reverently
		Left-to-right: an ancient-looking scrap of cloth with fine gold embroidery, dark blue/teal item that looks like a congealed blob the size of a softball, large pile of fine ash (an amount that would be more than a created human's)
		Tetron and Iris consider these
			Tetron understands that these are remains, and they aren't just here for show - they serve a purpose here
			Iris has heard of "weavers", "seamstresses", etc before, and the thread these creatures weave with thrum with arcane energy.  Additionally, there are creature who deal in this sort of thing who can be contacted through infernal means, but better contacted through fey means
	Iris rummages through Sloane's stuff
		She has magic weapons, a binding snare, mage bane
	Tetron checks the halfling
		Blightburn resin
	Cheliff
		A few more health pots (one greater and two moderate EoLs), and a glue bomb
		Credentials
		Keys
		Greater striking
	Viola: speaking of papers, we should rummage for evidence
