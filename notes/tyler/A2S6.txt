Starting outside Gardenia House, Sunday late morning
-Alistair advises against seeing Sloane at present, though he guesses the party can try
We head to the Bulwark and Bolt
-We're let in immediately
-Sloane is impressed that we completed trial and got certified in one go
-Sloane's philosophy is that parties should share info within
-Sven Pallson - Sloane's fence
-Job
	-Protect a shipment scheduled for tomorrow (Moonday) night
	-Helja Redkiln - dwarven blacksmith (The Inheritor's Shield)
	-Worships Iomedae
	-Shipment heading to Almas
	-Credible sources claim that someone is looking to prevent the shipment
	-Need to protect the shipment as it heads down to the docks
	-Sloane doesn't want Helja to know that Sloane is involved
	-Last shipment of Helja's, and then she's headed to Lastwall (some sort of Iomedaean initiative)
	-Route: shop to the docks south of Oldtown
	-Are there any city guards helping?  No, she's too damn proud
	-Shipment is larger than usual (normally just a weapon or two)
	-Who's the troublemaker?  One of two options: local band of criminals (Remora's gang) or competing smithy (Joan)
		-Remora's danger is her knowledge
		-Joan looks like a female Adam Driver
	-Ship departs at 7 PM, so make sure we're ready to help before then
	-There will be a team to help transport
	-Alleyways and secondary streets likely to make up most of route
	-Shipment is pro-bono
	-Why Sloane likes Helja
		-She has a good mentality where she does pro-bono work for those in need
-Other info regarding the leak?
	-Sloane hasn't heard anything
	-We're meeting with Belcalis tonight
-Iomedaen worshippers have been heading to Lastwall en masse
-Tetron has just left the mental hospital
	-Crosses paths with the party outside Sloane's (as does Nilbog)
-Return to Pretty Prancer
	-Guard outside, wants to escort Viola and party to Fort Constance for interview regarding Falcon's Hollow
-At Fort Constance
	-"She's dangerous, and her allies appear to be too."  Someone needs classified info and reinforcements.  "We need people to clear the forest."  This is in regard to Tessra Briarwood.
	-We see Marcellus exit from a meeting room.  Dude has been super fucked up medically, and he's pissed.
	-Valin and Aakiri are left in the room behind.  Three figures are seated with them (Barnes, Mayor Olorin, Gavel Shanks).
		-Olorin is holding a bassinet (baby within)
-Interview
	-Informal setup in the room
	-Viola testifies, omitting the gatestone
	-Olorin responds at the end
	-Gov't concerned with Harg's conflict of interest being the one who tried Teedum despite being involved in that same election.
		-Viola insists that Sgt. Yafet and Jane Langlead can attest to the overwhelming evidence against Teedum and Kreed.
	-Gavel Shanks apologizes for the incident and claims that such behavior won't happen again
		-Tetron asks whether Shanks has specific initiatives to improve
			-Ledgers
			-Investigations
			-Oregent
			-Profits have nosedived since the attack
		-Shanks is new to the position (less than 1 year)
			-He claims the consortium needs a new direction
				-This includes improved working conditions
			-Shanks fought in the People's Revollt.
	-Olorin explains that many troops have been deployed to borders
		-She would like us to aid the city in taking up cases of local criminal activity by accompaning Marcellus's group out of Augustana to track down Tessra.
			-Meet with Valin and Aakiri (we've been given the address)
			-Payment: 250 gp
			-They head out early Wealday.  Headed into the southern Arthfell Forest.
			-Tessra has a lieutenant and around 20 other followers (Kellid, for the most part), plus a large flying "beast" (it's red)
				-Beast has left behind burnt trees
			-Locals believe that Tessra is seeking some kind of item
				-We ask what the item could be.  The government has contracted folks at Agrimony Point to look into a "gatestone".
					-If you get two of them for the same gate, you gain access to ancient portals of an elven nature
						-The portals have only been reappearing recently.  Could be an indication of Alseta's power waning?
					-They see it as a security risk.  Stones need to be controlled.  Destroying them would potentially cut off a possible economic advantage.
					-The Kellids that attacked were probably not from Andoran, but instead from Taldor, according to Andoran intelligence.  This may mean they already have access to a gatestone.
					-Kellids view the gatestones religiously, so Andoran is cognizant of how carefully they need to proceed in that regard.
		-Tetron intuits that Andoran is wary of invasion on account of the handouts we found near Eagle's Knot, plus existing tensions he's familiar with from his military days.  Chelish raids around Eagle's Knot as well.
		-Tetron asks whether the attackers could be from a neighboring country
			-Yes, word from Galt is that an invasion may occur.  Plus, the darkwood supply disruption weakens Andoran's position
			-Taldor has historically been peaceful with Andoran, but there is a lack of trust.
				-Supreme Elect Marasek has a good relationship with Grand Queen Eutropia, but the War for the Crown has made Taldor's military weaker.
	-This is our first indication that Tessra may have been involved in the attack, per Marcellus's testimony.  We do mention that we never saw any evidence of her involvement.
	-We go aside to discuss Krug's concern regarding hiding the gatestone from the government.  Viola and Tetron voice their distrust, especially regarding the Gavel, and Krug understands.
	-We are dismissed
-Viola returns to the Quarter Deck Tavern
	-Viola informs the guy that she can't make the Wealday show
	-Guy offers this evening as an alternative, which conflicts with the Zaugia thing as well.
-Alistair goes to find Sven Pallson
	-The fence shop is in the back of a florist shop
	-Alistair starts presenting stuff to Sven, who inspects the authenticity
	-He gets 12 pp out of the deal
	-Sven doesn't haggle
-Tetron goes to entertain with magic at the Slopes
	-Makes bank
	-Gets recognized by a rando
-Krug and Nilbog go to pray at the temple
	-Krug is doubtful that our lack of trust in the officials is the right way to go
	-Vision has both Krug and Nilbog sitting on a hill overlooking Augustana (the hill doesn't actually exist)
		-They see a beautiful night sky overhead as time seems to move quickly
		-They notice the stars brighten in succession, and then as the sky becomes incredibly bright, the stars each begin to go out
		-A great sense of unease; they hope it is not a portent for the future
	-Nilbog feels pressured to do the right thing, but he doesn't know what that is
	-The clerk who accosted Nilbog last time regarding the farting walks up.  Nilbog isn't farty this time, much to their relief
-Back at the hotel, Krug and Nilbog explain what they saw
	-Religion check: Aroden died on the day he was supposed to lead humanity to glory.  This short of vision shouldn't be happening anymore because prophecies broken when Aroden died (Age of Lost Omens).
-Summons for Sloane from a teenager
	-Zaknos and Tetron investigate sandwich shops before heading up to The Slopes
		-They set up at an upscale restaurant to "be seen"
	-The rest of a party is led through a maze of alleys to a cart of rotten apples a few blocks from the harbor, and then the boy leaves
	-Dame Belcalis is led in by a different street urchin
		-She recognizes Krug and Nilbog
		-"I was teasing that man for so long."  She must have been connected to Surtic.
	-Alistair explains our mission, having to interrupt Nilbog's claims of being a delivery service.
	-Precautions for security: don't stick out
		-Belcalis offers Viola her shawl to cover up how loud her outfit is
	-Going through Copperdown; it's kind of declining
	-We arrive at the Dockward Hold, a grounded and sideways ship serving as a building - this is Zaugia's base of operations
		-The flag on it is an orc hold logo, but crossed out
-Meeting with Zaugia
	-Dame Belcalis waves Virok, the swole bodyguard, aside, and we enter
	-Belcalis has us sit and takes her shawl back
	-No windows
	-From behind a curtained door, a redheaded young orc woman enters
		-Starts with an amused snort
	-Zaugia is concerned with our connection to Sloane, whom she does not trust
		-Connection to Cheliax?  Worship of some god?  Sus shit?
		-Alistair mentions his take of her having been hard crime before and mellowed out over the years
		-Sloane is a known member of a group called "Aegis Coalition"
			-Andoran charity organization, with elements in Galt, Taldor, and Cheliax
	-Zaugia asks what we have to offer and who we are
		-We offer our services
		-Radiant Dawn, trying to do good and keep the peace
		-Good diplo check means that she'll help us
		-Zaugia already bought the info
		-Our job is to find out what Sloane's second favor is and how it goes
			-Zaugia insists that our job isn't the last
			-"They begin benign"  "She has fingers in many pots in this city"  "Why are they transporting so many good"
				-Equipment headed to Taldor?
				-This has been going on for years, much earlier than the border woes
		-Drinks offered, Krug enjoys, Viola coughs it out.
	-Additional job: an associate needs aid
		-It's fucking Blaire!!!
		-They're gathering information on a Chelish informant
			-The informant is a member of the guard at Fort Constance
			-The informant is to be eliminated, dead or alive
		-Folks in the slopes are suspected to be Chelish sympathizers
		-Informant is set to patrol in Copperdown on Toilday
		-Viola asks for allies as payment: we explain the K Ego AS conspiracy situation
		-Blaire is investigating the Aegis Coalition
		-150 gp on offer
	-Viola asks about the Head Gavel
		-Hasn't met him
		-Info is mostly through his military career
		-Worked in local gov't and as a woodcutter
		-Sources say he was honest and forthright
		-Made reforms in Oregent
			-But the attack on Falcon's Hollow
		-Doesn't trust him any different than other politicians
-Back at dinner
	-Zaknos detects movement!!!
		-Dramatic irony: it's not Blaire
