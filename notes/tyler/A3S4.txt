Just off the boat in Almas, Fireday afternoon
	Crew is unloading folks' stowed items, but we have our stuff already
	Tetron asks Amos where the Olgirs are staying
		He's in the middle of "supervising" his goods being unloaded
		He always stays at Faldor's Farm Kitchen, which has an attached inn
			Tetron has heard of it
				It's more expensive, but the food is really good
				The focus on food is at the expense of the lodging
				It's on the border of Concord and Flag
					Great location for certain people, like Almas
	Tetron and Alistair consult about the lodging situation
		Alistair knows of a couple that served as safe houses
		Tetron knows about a few places around the university and in residential areas
			Hasn't stayed himself
			He considers Woonhall
				The Four Swords is a former bardic college near Woonhall
					Decent food
					Has performances
					He pitches it
						Viola knows it by reputation
		Alistair knows about a safehouse inn in the northwest corner of the UofA district
	Viola mentions that we probably want to stay near where we operate
		We do have cause to be near UofA
		The IMG branch is in the Liberty District
			Liberty District would be expensive to stay in or near
We eventually decide to stay in the southern Flag District
	Advantage being that we have easy access to basically everywhere in eastern Almas via the main road
	Birch Branch is the inn we find
	Bunking
		Tetron and Alistair - 4sp each/night
		Viola, Zaknos, Krug, and Nilbog - 1sp each/night
Tetron recommends visiting a job board
	There are three within decent walking distance

Meet back at the paella place
	We have paella
	Swap quest details
		Tetron hands a stub over to Viola
		Alistair interested in the gov't job
		Tetron and Viola interested in Siren of Cassomir
			Viola has heard the name, she's been going around
				Not familiar with her actual performances
				She claims to be inventing a new instrument
		Domestic violence seems to be of interest to most of us
		Krug tells Nilbog about the Sarenrae quest
	Tetron listening to other people talk
		"I hate that rat bastard"
			Someone has been claiming carriages
			Halflings living outside The Half are suspicious
			Bought a wagon out from an entire troupe
		An orc woman walks in with a child, talking to another orc woman
			"It's really exciting that you're still seeing him."
			"Ernesto is a nice young man."  He's "different"
			Ernesto's sister is scary
				She got fired from the Consortium
			Ernesto isn't like his sister
			Second woman is scared for the first
		"The Clutch's territory is expanding"
			Leader was apparently around in different parts of the city
			Leader is apparently a young woman
			The Clutch is breaking up families
			Eric's brother is always with the leader, Eric is apparently chill
	We pay and leave
Tetron looks to check mail and go shopping
	To the letter courier
		She does have it
Viola goes down to Woonhal
	She sees the posters for Gwen Cantata along the way
	She walks into the Eight Cups Theatre
		Looks like practice is soon
		She walks over to the stage director
			Human man in black
			He's talking to a halfling man with very curly hair in the shape of a helmet
				Orange and blue attire
				"Do you know who I am?  I could get this whole place shut down."
				"If this show doesn't get off the ground, we're going to look like fools!"
			The argument goes on for a while
				"There isn't as much talent as you'd believe"
				Native talent going off to Taldor
		Viola gets her turn
			Director asks for experience
		Viola notices a dark-furred catfolk looking at her
			"Can I help you?"
			Dude has seen Viola's shows before
			Wants to know if she's staying in town
				He has a friend with a "guild" of sorts
				He's the one who gave her the coin
				The guy is a scout for Protection for the Talented
					They locate people in the arts who seem like they have the ability for "greatness"
					They offer a "training ground" of sorts
				Viola is super flustered
				Tybalt is the catfolk's name
Zaknos goes to check for Amos at Faldor's Farm
	The place is huge and smells like the roast of all roasts
	The Olgirs are indeed there, alongside some apparent business associates
	Zaknos approaches
		He tells Amos that we aren't staying there
		Amos asks where instead (Birch Branch)
		Amos tells Zaknos that they might drop by to have Viola read Fleche that bedtime story
		Amos invites Zaknos to pop in whenever
			Their roast goose is apparently the best
		Amos is staying in Almas for at least a couple of weeks
			A shipment coming from up north is late
			Maybe we can go together again
				Their next stop is Cassomir by land
					Customs by sea sucks, apparently
Tetron looks for work
	At Flags
	Potion crafting
	It doesn't go well
Viola finds an armorer
	She commissions a potency rune
		Done tomorrow
	She finds Tetron along the way
		Tetron has just presented a less-than-adequate barkskin potion to a customer
		Viola asks what's going on
Nighttime now
	Alistair puts on his dark clothes and heads to a safehouse between UofA and Tamuth
		Is it still secure?
		Looks unmolested
		Lights on; occupied
		Alistair knocks, the person at the door is surprised
		Door opens to reveal a dark-skinned woman in blue
			Wearing thieves' gloves
			Alistair has met this person, but not talked that much
			She is called the "Mother of Crow"
			She was a member of the Almas Thieves' Guild
		Alistair tells her that he left town 2 months ago
			Joined an adventuring party
			Heard things have changed
			What's still safe?
		She offers tea
		Ever since Dofinn was captured, retention has been awful
		The Clutch sprung up outside Timberfell
			Note: Kids in the guild weren't allowed to go to Timberfell
			One of the guild members, Frey, who butted heads with Dorfinn, and she defected to The Clutch
			She doesn't know 
			Daniel and Eric are the names of the founders; Eric is part of the Consortium, is true leader
			Frey poses as the leader
		Her son (Mateo) is rash, and he took Dorfinn's arrest poorly
		Miss Kara and Muriel are still with the guild
		[TO BE CONTINUED DUE TO MISCOMMUNICATION]
	The Olgirs drop by
		Zaknos forgot to tell Viola that they were coming
		Viola makes up some isekai bullshit, and it's the best story Fleche has ever heard
Starday dawns
	Viola picks up her armor
	Domestic violence
		The meetup location isn't at the home specifically
		We're greeted by a haggard woman
			"Are you here for the board?"
		She lets us in
		She apologizes 
		She is Wendy
		Her sister Leslie was married to a man
		Wendy is from Augustana, and traveled to visit Leslie
		The husband doesn't let Wendy see her sister
		Dude's eyes look bloodshot, people can hear screaming and stuff from inside
		What does he do that requires guards?
			He just has them
		Wendy hasn't met the guy before
			Leslie is kind and gentle
			She never mentioned anything
		Dude's name is Harrison Hoyert
		Wendy runs the family business as the oldest
		Their neighbors might be a good starting point
		Harrison has a shop, but it's been closed the last few days
		Wendy arrived a couple of days ago
		Leslie has medium, pinned back hair
			Petit woman, beautiful, white
	Check in with the cops
		We walk past the house on the way by
			We hear a wailing of sorts
		We're greeted by a bored half-elf
		They do have a case file
			They were going to look into it tomorrow night
			They didn't prioritize it because the report came outside the household and the reported is not from Almas
			Tetron tries to pressure the guy to help us with some urgency
			Their normal procedure is that neighbors report it
		Is there a record on Harrison?
			Only business stuff
			Dude receives raw ore and distributes it to blacksmiths
			Viola makes a note of the address
			No criminal history
		Complaint was filed two nights ago in the early hours
	We head to Harrison's store
		Nothing fancy
		"Hoyert's Metal Distributor"
		No one sus around
		Tetron detects magic
			Nothing sus, just some tools
		Alistair goes around back
			No one there
			There's a doormat
				There's a spare key
			Open it up
		Alistair goes into the storeroom
			Bins of ore
			He lets us in
		We look for anything that's out-of-place or indicative of a recent change
			Small locket on his desk, with a portrait of Leslie and a small pressed flower
			Small circular object, light, clacks when shaken
			Alistair looks for secret stuff
			Alistair looks at some paperwork
				Home address listed is consistent with what we know already
			Tetron looks at ledgers
				Mostly local, some orders from Augustana
			Krug looks for mail
				Business stuff
				Last deal with a local smithy
					This is a frequent client
			Half-eaten sandwich
				We determine that it wasn't left in his hasty exit
			Who was working the day he closed?
				Three folks
				Tetron suggests looking into the person working at the front then
					They live over on the west side of Castoff Place
	Out of the city
		Small residence
		Half-elven or elven man with long wavy hair
		Hoyert left in a hurry because someone came in reporting that his wife had gone into labor
		Hoyert was apparently intending to power through
	Back to Wendy's
		She didn't know
		The letters told her to expect a surprise
		But why the guards, though?
	Over to the Hoyerts'
		Viola, Tetron, and Krug go up to the guards
			Viola presents us as making a wellness check on behalf of the city guard
			Guards give a bit of resistance, but they go ask
			Harrison says no
			Tetron presses that the report to the police was that there was potential domestic abuse
			Guard asks again
			Harrison relents
		Inside the house
			Harrison asks what we want
			Viola explains that we just want to know why Wendy couldn't come and why there are guards
				Wendy thinks that there may be abuse
					Harrison is appaled at the suggestion
			Harrison explains that Leslie and two of the triplets died during childbirth
				We offer condolences
			However, "Leslie" is still active; undead
				Harrison insists that we can't go upstairs
			He took out a loan to resurrect Leslie and the dead triplets
				Krug is concerned about the unnaturality of this, assuming necromancy
				Viola verifies that Harrison got in contact with a legit cleric
			Tetron presses that Leslie needs to be all the way dead for the resurrection to work
				He studied for years at the University of Almas, he has the chops
			We're adventurers, this is our job
			"We're doing this for Leon."
			Harrison lets us pass
		Up the stairs
			At the door, Viola asks what we know about the undead
				Turns out, barely anything
