Oathday, 29 Lamashan, Late Morning
	At the Loin and Tallow
		Jimenez holds up a piece of paper to show the cops
			It's a proof of purchase
			The police give it a look
				But her patronage to Ted Hoffman is still valid
				So that's a 100 gp fine
		Alistair points out that there's more to Jimenez's wrongdoing
			On account of selling bodies to Marina's Catch
			He offers to go get the guards who took the madame
				Main point is that Jimenez could be a flight risk
				His argument falls flat - they won't detain Jimenez without a warrant
				Alistair doubles down, pointing out that the madame is the other party to the illegal purchase
			Alistair bails to go get the other cops anyway
		Meanwhile, Jimenez is chatting with the guards
			He's moving his hand around under the counter
				Tetron can't see what's going on from our angle, so he moves around to see
				Tetron catches the final movements of what's definitely a spell
					He calls out to get down
INITIATIVE
	Iris reacts to Tetron's callout with a death glare
	Round 1
		Viola tackles the cops to the ground and then takes her parry stance
		Iris analyzes Jimenez, calls out that he's casting a spell, then stabs (miss, crit)
			No weakness, conjuration spell pending
			Frightened 1
		Jimenez drops off the counter with a stomp, casts a different spell: translocate, which has the added effect of hitting all of us with diabolic energy, then climbs up a pipe
		Tetron activates his winged boots, casts haste on Viola on her request
		Krug helps up the guards and carries them to safety
	Round 2
		Viola poofs up to the room where Jimenez is just climbing up, crit-feints, then hits him with a non-lethal finisher
		Iris steps outside, makes a dupe, and stabs Jimenez
		Jimenez tries to run, but Iris interrupts him with a stab to a major artery, killing him
After combat
	We start arguing about Iris killing Jimenez
		There are about a dozen civilians around
	Alistair returns with those other cops to find our scene
	We get led away by the police to Greyguard
At Greyguard
	We sit outside Dupont's office for several hours
	He was at the tribunal
	He's not happy to see us
	He gestures us in
		We GOTTA stop the extrajudicial kidding
After Dupont tells us off
	Tetron goes off to rumor-monger to make us sound better in the Jimenez situation
	Alistair goes to scope Jimenez's shop
		No guards
		He goes in to scoop up incriminating documents
			In through the back first
				Someone's here - Jimenez's son
					But he's asleep
				Alistair finds a small back office space
					Metal door
					No windows to exterior
					Trapped?  The keyhole is actually false - it's a trap!
					So how to open the door, then?
						Well, there're records to the side of the door
							Looking for incriminating stuff plus any mechanism
							Ledgers for procurement of bodies and such
						How about the nearby freezers?
							One has a lock (labelled "exotic meats")
								He picks it open
								No meat, instead a tunnel down
					Inside the back office
						It's refrigerated in here
						Infernal shrine, work surface, paperwork, correspondence, diabolic paperwork, locket inside a glass case
							That locket looks evil - maybe leave it alone
						What about valuables?
							Four bars of some metal
								But he doesn't know what it is
							Folder containing paperwork and 300 gp (as a check)
							Grey bag of crushed velvet
								Something clacky inside
									Sounds gemmy
								An evil gasping sound emits as he opens the bag
									And there are diamonds, big ones at that
								He takes the bag
						He takes the locket case, rather than opening it
							It leaves an obvious dustless area
								Prestidigitation fixes that
					Alistair leaves, the kid stays asleep
		Back outside
			Alistair has that same feeling of something approaching him that he felt after Cheliff's apartment
				A creepy voice: "Hair like wheat!  We just want to talk!"
				But he can't see whatever is producing the voice
				Alistair makes a break for it
Black Pit Tavern
	Alistair appears, winded
		He rattles off finding stuff at Jimenez's place and an angry spirit
			Viola suggests talking to Iris about it
				Later, then
			Alistair gives Tetron stuff to identify
				The locket has containment magic in it, and something is within
				Tetron has seen something of this metal's make for the first time recently
				The center of each diamond has some slight discoloration
					Could be fakes, altered, etc...
					The evil gasping sound is still faintly audible
					Can't identify it, but he figures that it's unsuitable for rezzing
	Meanwhile, Iris is venting to Sloane about being "persecuted" over how she handled Jimenez
		No argument from Sloane
		Sloane hasn't interfaced with Jimenez herself, but she's done work around Capra, and she doesn't have a high opinion of them either
		Sloane asks what memory Iris has been using to focus when trying to maintain the mirror
			Losing her arm, since that's the worst pain ever, and everything else is like a pin-prick in comparison
				Keeps things in focus - eyes on the prize: killing Abigale
	Tetron gives us the heads-up that tomorrow night is when he turns back
	Borgon complains about Timpani
		She hasn't done anything wrong, but her joy pisses him off
	Iris comes over
		She lets Borgon stay over if it'll shut him up
		She gives her defense of how she handled Jimenez
			It's not like any of us are really upset
			Alistair mentions the diabolic shrine
				THANK YOU
		She looks at the locket
			It's saying something, but very faintly, but in a language we don't know
			Tetron casts Translate
				The words are in Celestial
				"Can you hear me?  Are you listening?"
					He nods
					He asks if it can understand Common
						It does
					Interview questions
						Name: Samuel
						What happened: Some otherworldly being trapped it
							It wants to get back to a crossroads
								Near Slatedown
									That's where the Murkback Keep mercs went
							It's a feminine-presenting entity that hungers for the arcane
								OH FUCK IT WAS KASISSA...
								Do we risk pissing her off?
									We're in a demi-plane, so she likely wouldn't get alerted
				Alistair checks for traps
					Nope, but the box is magically closed
					Tetron's got it
						It's a system of magical tradition labels and incantations for relevant spells
						Box is open
					Tetron opens the locket
						He hears Kasissa's voice as it opens
							She acknowledges how close we are to her location
			The guy pops out
				He's gonna jet, but he offers us a boon in the meantime
					Tetron: If you can find some way to dissuade Kasissa from coming after us, that'd be awesome
						She's gonna stay there for a while
							She's eating away at the border between planes, gaining power
							It was the site of a major battle in which Aroden participated
					Where did the locket come from?
						House Karthis, then House Deschamps
							Tetron: What intel do you have on Deschamps?
								Nothing we don't already know
						What about Jimenez?
							Samuel saw his activity with the infernal shrine
								He brought Jalina in there twice...
					He gives us a waystone, speaks his testimony into it, then hands it over to Tetron
					Alistair asks whether he saw anything from the Spacious Pouch
						Only darkness
						So nothing on the looming spirit, then
							Yup
							Quick scan: it's not here
					He heads out
Evening of Fireday, 30 Lamashan
	We've been at the tribunal all day
		Though we did drop off the evidence against Jimenez
	Tetron's transformation is slowly beginning
		He takes the stuff he got from the Great Eye
		Krug is ready with LoH
		Cyrus holding Tetron's hand
		Pain and agony
		He can feel the lack of the primal power
	Back to normal
		But he can feel the urge...
		Tetron may now cast primal spells from scrolls and such (DC 5 flat check)
		Krug picks him up and cleans him off
Late morning of Starday, 31 Lamashan
	Cyrus has gotten a head-start on Tetron's morning prep
	Tetron and Cyrus sort out their own room
	Today is the Vaylen/Prialla Funeral
		Streets starting to fill with respects-payers
	Someone's waiting for us outside the tavern
		Taldan soldier
		Samuel's testimony has fully bopped Jimenez
		We're entirely off the hook
		Tetron: What's the status of the orphan?
			When found, he explain that he had been adopted by Jimenez
			So many orphans these days...  Might get taken in over here.  Might get taken in across the river.  Might end up in Cur's Tooth.
			Tetron advises that they keep an eye out, given that he may retaliate, either in confusion or intentionally
		Tetron: Can we have the waystone back?
			Shouldn't we keep it on file?
				Could transcribe it
			She'd had to ask Dupont
	Alistair finds a blacksmith to help identify the metal ingots
		It catches his interest
			He has to do material tests to properly identify
				Except they don't indicate anything in particular
			So he brings it over to some stringed magical device
		Dude's surprised that a local villain would have something like this
		It's rare, adamantine-adjacent, crafted over ley lines
			Divine-resistant, can mute or eccentuate magic
			[OOC note: this is what the blue slave had on them]
			Doesn't know the name or value
			Warning: don't advertise that you have this
