Fireday, afternoon
	As Tetron disintegrates Baron Bain's body...
		A presence in his mind feels muffled or far away
		A choice in Tetron's mind
			Counteracting spells
	Tetron starts rifling through Baron Bain's shit
		Type 4 Ring of Wizardry
		His clothes and glasses
		Fine wizard robe
	Deckhands start getting rid of the horned drake's corpse
		And also Grantham and Jessie
		Alistair asks for some valuable bits first
	One hour remaining to hoard
	Krug does communal LoH and Treat Wounds
		Inc Dominic and Shinbira
	Bohja comes to the bow where Iris is standing
		She points out into the distance, where there's a lump of trees
			She says that's where the hoard is
			Not safe to touch down there, so they're going to drop us off as close as they can and keep nearby
			She warns of "wild folk" in the area
			Due to dragons' territoriality, we're extremely unlikely to come across any others
			Dragons mark their territory by various means
				Follow the smell
			Avoid contact with plants, esp eating
		She expresses concern about Viola being brought along
			Viola insists that there's never enough adventure
Fireday, dusk
	Bhoja tells us that they're going to lower us down via rope
		Do not drop early
		She gives Iris a flare to signal for pickup
	Tetron approaches Viola to consider staying behind
		Viola insists, even after he tries to lie about there being some kind of adventure below deck
		Iris takes responsibility for Viola after insisting that she's good to go
	Iris validates that Viola can IFF
	Bhoja asks who (besides Viola) would like to go first
		Iris defers on account of being responsible of Viola
		Alistair slides down
		Then the rest of us
	It's dark down here
		Tetron lights up, which attracts bugs
			Viola is extremely perturbed
	So, which way now?  Downhill is less apparent than it looked from above
		Krug's got the right of it: the flow of water is downhill, and ambient sounds decrease in the direction of danger
		After a bit, we locate a shoddy boardwalk across deeper bits of muck
	After crossing the boardwalk, Krug starts seeing tracks of larger creatures
		Also bits of shell, magic debris, etc
		Terribly acrid and burnt smell, especially over near a large tree that arches over a path beyond
		He also notices an odd, dark maroon fern
			Looks warped
			Definitely unnatural, probably a mark of divine favor/disfavor
				Tetron gives it a closer look
					Leaf texture is inconsistent (jagged, curls, etc)
					The roots look like they're leeching from the earth around them, as the ground is devoid of other life
	Smell gets stronger and stronger
		Borgon starts complaining
		Alistair notices that we're heading into a low spot where water is pooling in from all sides
			The water is not where the smell is coming from
		Tetron and Alistair start scanning for traps and hazards
		On our side of the waterhold is a circular wall with a censer
			Atop the wall is a horned creature, humanoid in shape
				It's watching us
				But it's dark, so we can't see it particularly well
				Tetron and Iris identify it as a Lamashtan fleshwarp
					Iris knows further that it's crafted for service
				Tetron calls out to it in Draconic
					No response, but it tenses up
					Repeat in Infernal, but still no reply
					Sylvan?  Nope
					Iris insists that he just try Taldane
				It looks between the five of us, then glances at the censer
					Tetron finally asks in Common who it serves
						"WE SERVE THE GROÃŸMUTTER, AND YOU ARE UNINVITED GUESTS!"
							Iris: listen, we killed your boss, we'll let you live if you go fuck off somewhere
							Meanwhile, Alistair starts sneaking around the waterhold to flank
							Tetron shoops his light over toward the creature to get a better look at it
								It hisses and retreats
							Iris straight-up asks what the censer is for
								"TUCKHORN HAS NO TIME TO FIGHT"
								It explains that the dragons like it (referring to it as a thurimble)
									The censer marks Isadore's turf
								Iris asks what Lamashtu would do about us putting out the thurimble
									Things in this lair would be pissed
								Iris is all like "I'mma gonna loot the place anyway"
									She's pissed
INITIATIVE
	Round 1
		Alistair sneaks in through the back hole in the wall and stabs Tuckhorn (crit, hit)
		Iris runs up to Tuckhorn and stabs (hit)
		Tetron advances and looks at a chest, finding no traps
		Krug advances and uses Sun Blade (miss)
		Viola runs up and stabs (hit), killing Tuckhorn
After combat
	Tetron inspects the chest further, but he defers to Alistair to go look at other loot
		We've found powdered incense for use in the thurimble
			It's in two huge jars
			Tetron takes 150 gp worth (for use in Contact Friends ritual)
			The rest is still super valuable
				Tetron happens to have sheepskins that can stretch over the jars to close them
				And then he shoves it in his stretchy spacious pouch
	There's a journal
		Iris looks it over
			It's not trapped, but it's radiating unholy vibes
				She reads it
				It's Tuckhorn's writings
					Surprisingly touching and reverent
					She and her siblings were brought here to serve a spirit that once inhabited a wyrm
						Can take on draconic or humanoid form
							Iris surmises that it might be referring to Isadore
						Originally came from Dunholme, leaving distruction in its wake as it came to this place
						Ripped out its own heart and placed it in a cavern below
					The thurimble keeps other dragons away
						Iris decides to make them work for it, since the site is a good spot for dragon dens
		Iris gives Tetron the heads-up
	Alistair looks for traps on the chest
		Nothing
		Open 'er up
			A wailing spirit appears and gouges out her own eyes, causing his own eyes to bleed
				Krug goes over to try to stop the bleeding, but he can't
				Tetron uses his staff of healing and the bleeding stops
			Loot
				Composite shortbow with red dragon scales on it
					Attached to it is a spellheart in the shape of a wyrm claw
	So now what?
		Iris: Swimming?
			Alistair: Probably
			Tetron volunteers to reallocate for water breathing
		Alistair goes to scout in the water
			The current in the center of the hole is pulling downward
			Lots of bones at the bottom, both humanoid and reptilian
		Reallocation finished: water breathing
	Into the waterhole
		It's murky
		Current gently but firmly brings us along
		We get dumped into a cavern
	Cavern
		Two mounds within
			One swirls upward with plant life scattered around it
		Stone slab above that retains liquid
		Three creatures
			Quadraped skeleton with canine skull covered in swamp flora
			Hulking fat figure with multiple hearts strung around its neck and antlers
			Humanoid atop the spiral
