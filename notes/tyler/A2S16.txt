CAVE-IN - Ali, Nilbog, Zaknos, Tetron
	Alistair rolls a success on the reflex - half damage!
	Wolf, Krug, and Viola obscured
	Alistair half-buried, but his hands aren't free
	Kiruka begins to help Alistair out, freeing him after 4 minutes
		He is crushed a bit in the meantime
	Zaknos, Tetron, and Nilbog start trying to clear the way forward
		Valin too
Krug and Viola now
	Viola leaps and tumbles out of the way
	Krug is stuck and suffocating
	Viola lights a torch and starts trying to dig Krug out
	Krug manages to push enough to move rocks that Viola can see, and she exposes an air hole for him
	While this is going on, heavy chain sounds
	By the time Krug and Viola start talking, the chain sounds stop with a large crash
	Kellids riding huge boars show up, Viola immediately surrenders
	The Kellids find Krug and take his Kellid necklace, and the boars start to dig him out
	Debate among the Kellids regarding what to do about Krug and his necklace
	Once dug out, they take Krug prisoner too
	Viola and Krug are bound, gagged, and ear-plugged and taken away
Back to others
	They feel a tremor
	Digging continues
	After a decent amount is cleared, Zaknos senses movement from under the rock and quickly digs towards it
	The movement stops eventually as the last wolf dies
	Another tremor, though
	They find Viola's torch and evidence of Krug and Viola having been captured
	Tetron confronts Nilbog
		Tries and fails to grab at him
		"What the heck were you trying to do?"
		Alistair says that there isn't time for this
			"I need to make sure we don't have another cave-in"
		Nilbog apologizes
	Valin says that since the Kellids know we're there, it may be a good idea to go back and join Marcellus instead
		Tetron insists that we won't lead Krug and Viola behind
		Zaknos offers to scout on ahead
	Zaknos starts to follow the trail
		He finds additional rail tracks
		He finds dead bodies and an old cave-in
			Some people who look like miners, but more that look like mercs
			Some of the limbs look like they've been snacked off
		The railways converge at a single point
		Cave-ins appear to be deliberate and strategic
		Trail leads toward a back tunnel
		Tetron and Alistair sneak behind Zaknos
		Past a morgue of sorts, he spots an area where it looks like the Kellids stopped for a little bit; he calls the others forward to join him
	Tetron steps forward to look at the morgue
		Covered bodies on top of a table
		They're been there a while
	Alistair notices a thin sliver of light past the morgue
		It's oddly dark and quiet
		He moves forward cautiously
	Alistair sets off a Glyph of Warding
		It targets Nilbog
		CRIT FAIL
		Nilbog is dropped instantly from full health by a lightning bolt
		Kiruka rushes in to stabilize Nilbog
			"Do any of you know how to heal?"
		Tetron gives Nilbog a healing pot
			"That's what you get.  Don't make me cast it again."
	They stop to heal
		Nilbog and Alistair
Meanwhile, the prisoners
	We can kind of hear through the gauze they shoved in our ears
		They're hanging out around Krug
		They take his shield and inspect it
		Older male voice sounds really angry, grabbing at Viola's hair
		Someone else walks up to Viola
			Voice is female, gently musical
			Smells of fish
			She then goes over to Krug
		A phrase is said
			[this would have been the passcode to go through the Glyph of Warding]
		We're laid down on a metal platform that lifts us up
		Krug and Viola are separated and put in rooms
		Krug first
			He's set down
			They unbind his legs, remove his earplugs and blindfold
			He sees a yellow-haired woman who's lithe, small, and cleaner than others
				She's the fish-smelling one
			She points to Krug's shield and says something
				Old Kellid man is pissed and leaves
			She makes a "calm" gesture at Krug
			His weapons aren't confiscated
		Viola now
			Shoved violently into a cell
			After a while, they pull her up by the hair and clean her off to get a better look at her face
			Weapons confiscated
			Chained up by one leg and one arm
		Back to Krug
			After a while, a small Kellid woman slides a cup of water to him
			The angry man returns and sits there with a weapon
			He speaks broken Common
				He asks why Krug came in through the back of cave
				Krug says we're here to find a friend
				"Who friend?"
				Marcellus
				Old man doesn't like that
				He asks whether he's here to attack
				Krug says he's trying to bring Marcellus back
				"Then retrieve him!"  He has a bunch of men outside.  "PAH!"
		Viola now
			Someone pulls her hair to stand her up
			Led somewhere else
			One of the gauze plugs is removed
			"Tell Marcellus to leave"
			Viola explains that Marcellus won't negotiate with her
			She's told to negotiate or die
			She is then shoved out into the rain
Back with other group
	They move to approach the platform
	Alistair looks around and finds three more glyphs of warding
	The tracks lead onto the platform, and then they terminate
	Tetron knows about glyph of warding
		They contain sudden bolt
	Alistair and Zaknos start to work on the glyphs
		Others back away
		First cleared
		Second gets set off
			Targeting Alistair
			Full damage
	Plan to get up the mineshaft
		The elevator blocks the whole width of the shaft, save for a gap that perhaps Alistair could fit through
		Tetron can levitate Alistair, then help him up to the beginning of the shaft so that he can levitate up the shaft's vertical surface
		Halfway up, use rope of climbing
		Bringing elevator down
Viola sent out to negotiate
	Good morning, introduction
	Viola doesn't know what the Kellids want
		They want Marcellus to stop attacking the gates and leave them alone and return gatestones
	Viola relays this, acknowledging that they don't have the gatestones, but they don't respond
	In an effort to get them to play along, Viola calls out Deadknuckle and admits to getting Teedum arrested
	This doesn't go over well, and Marcellus calls back saying that the time for negotiation is over
		He also asks where Valin is, and she responds that he's fine and with the others and the guide
	Viola acknowledges the hurt between him and Tessra, but she wants to stop the cycle of violence
	She calls out for Mr. Bilger and tells him that his family is doing well and that they miss him, and that they were very kind to the party
	She notes that Kreed had what was coming to him, and she apologizes for Marcellus getting caught up in it
	Final plea from Viola falls on deaf ears
More interrogation with Krug
	Old guy says negotiations aren't going well
	They won't talk to Viola, they'll only speak with "truth-sayer"
	"What do you know about the stones"
	Krug admits to us having them
Back with others
	Alistair floating up
	He deploys the rope
	At the top, he can hear screaming or shouting
	He peers through and sees a cat-like woman pointing down at the elevator, giving instructions
	Elevator is controlled by a massive winch; no manipulation without detection
	Alistair goes back down and reports
		He gets his new relic gift
	Tetron suggests ringing the bell and surrendering
	Valin suggests regrouping with Marcellus
	Kiruka says that she can call out and try to be friendly
		Valin objects
		"I know Tessra can be reasoned with"
	Alistair suggests that Valin head back alone
		Option chosen due to him being the most likely to start a fight
	Plan is to ring the bell to have folks come down
		Kiruka's opening: party means peace, and they'd like to know where the others are
	Alistair hides while the elevator descends
	Elevator lowers partway, then they hear an older angry voice, who shouts out in Common
		Kiruka responds in Hallit
			Viola and Krug's names are said
		After back-and-forth:
			Kiruka says the party is required to come peacefully (meaning, leaving their arms)
			Tetron recommends surrendering weapons
				Nilbog is resistant to giving up his scimitar, on account of its religious significance
	Elevator comes the rest of the way down
		Two figures on the elevator, but many people above
			One angry older man and a lithe younger woman
		Old man takes a defensive posture
		Woman is friendly and says "lick" in Common
			Tetron is confused, but he takes a bow
		Everyone except Alistair gets on the elevator
		Elevator goes back up without Alistair
		They're told to wait for a moment, and Tessra arrives
			She looks like she hasn't slept in a while
			"Have you come to bargain or to fight?"
			Kiruka speaks up, asking if Tessra recognizes her
				"Auntie?  What are you doing with these people?"
			Tetron says that we're here to negotiate and for the fighting to stop
			Tessra says that one of the people outside killed her mother, and another helped, and they were involved in the destruction of her brother's home
			"We sent the colorful one outside, she failed"
				"She doesn't really plan things"
				Viola hears this. "Tetron?  I never thought I'd be so glad to hear you shittalk me!"
				"They didn't listen, did they?"
				Tetron asks what they want instead of revenge: Marcellus and Cedrog must die and also return the stones
					Marcellus gave away Selma's location and Cedrog helped kill her
					Tetron says he doesn't believe that Marcellus's group has the stones
						Tessra says the others said the same thing
	Meanwhile, Krug's interrogation:
		He admits to having held onto them to keep them from being used for bad things
		Krug is taken back to the others
	Krug rejoins and appears completely fine
		Krug and Tetron catch each other up
	Tetron says that merely bringing Tessra Marcellus' and Cedrog's heads won't stop the fighting
		Tetron asks for a conference
		Krug asks where Alistair and Viola are
			Krug asks for Viola to be able to join us
	Viola is kicked in the stomach by the angry old guy
		Another voice enters and lifts Viola
		"Don't run"
		Viola is brought to the others
	Viola tells Tessra that we share an enemy
		Does she know about K Ego AS
Meanwhile, Alistair is sneaking to follow Valin
	Outside, in the rain, takes a while
	Valin makes a distinct bird-like whistle, and Marcellus comes out
	There's also a dude with just an axe and no armor, a pissed balding dwarf man, injured man holding his stomach, smaller man with a crossbow and chewing a toothpick, and a goblin woman
	The injured man can see Alistair, but he doesn't alert anyone
		This may be Mr. Bilger
	Alistair moves up to the injured man
		Increasing alarm as Alistair approaches, but he stops
		Can hear conversation between Valin and Marcellus
			Valin pleads with Marcellus, noting the glyphs of warding
			"I have no future!"  Claims Valin doesn't understand because he doesn't have anyone else he cares about
	The injured man whispers for water
		Alistair motions that he can't approach while Valin and Marcellus are there
		Alistair considers making some kind of distraction, but he's patient
Back with the others
	Tetron and Viola formally offer their aid, noting that they want to capture Marcellus and Cedrog because they want info about the conspiracy
		Even if we kill them and return the gatestones, Tessra's people might not be out of the woods yet
Back outside
	Alistair backs off makes his shrill whistle to create a diversion
		Valin and Cedrog see him, he runs, activating bracelet of dashing
		"There's a fucking kid!" Crossbow cocked
		Confusion ensues
Back inside
	Mid-heal, confused shouting is heard from outside
	Tetron, Krug, and Viola discuss gatestone situation
		Viola wants to know their plans afterward
Back outside
	Alistair heads out wide to double back
Party prepares
	One last try to negotiate
	Viola and Tetron try to appeal to stop the cycle of violence
	Tetron plays the angle of the conspiracy trying to play Tessra and Marcellus against each other
	Viola calls out Deadknuckle for not responding to any of the accusations
	"Do you want to know why your son really died?"
		"I WILL AVENGE MY SON!!!"
