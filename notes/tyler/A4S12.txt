Starday late morning
	Tetron has just messaged Alice
		Response is odd, like the words are pushed through a sieve
		"We were captured by the Coalition.  I'm not sure where we're being held, somewhere underground.  Borgon is hiding in the city, seek him.  Sorry."
		Tetron relays this to the rest of us
			Could send Taranis to go scout?
				Viola: this is Taldor's military port; maybe let's not get him shot down again
				Tetron considers how to make this work
					Noble status is nice
					Could make things easier with Adapt LAP status
					Could try to register with local authorities
	Go Adept?
		Viola: We're on a timeline, and might be a couple days
		Tetron: Good to get on the list anyway
		Cool
		Alistair's not here
			Tetron: 
	Alistair at the warehouse
		During our travels, there was an event that happened in both Almas and Augustana
			Terrorist cells were uncovered
				They were posing as Galtan immigrants
				City gov't has issued a travel advisory regarding Galt
				This explains the attacks from before
					Not Cheliax, it seems
		What can we help with?
			Want intel from the Taldan side regarding attack on Great Eye facility
				Rumors have been running through the Bellflower Network
				Scientific facility
				Diabolic forces at work against it
			Do we have any news on Murkback Keep?
				Never heard of it
				It's on the far east side of the Taldan city
		And with that, warehouse folks start putting out fires relating to Kaulfields' presence in the city
		Two-ish hours until Alistair's meeting with Tarik the Unclean
	Alistair goes wandering around the Andoren side
		Central New Codwin: Finds a thieves' sign pointing up
			Points at a drainage pipe that heads up toward a balcony
				Looks to be a good vantage point for the city
					But still can't see into Cur's Tooth because it lies pretty low
					He hears a faint cry on the other side of the river
						Guards have grabbed a child Alistair's age and cut off their thumb
							The perpetrator stows the thumb in his pouch
							Best Alistair can surmise, kid was probably a street thief
	Alistair decides to head across the border
		He finds the thumbless girl, left and ignored in the street
			She's barely conscious
			He pulls out his healer's tools and tries to help
				Very successful!
			As he works, people are also ignoring him
			She comes to, looks at Alistair, and is fucking astonished
				She asks why he helped
					Because she was hurt
				Where is home?
					"The Tooth"
				Is he a new recruit?
					Nope
				Does she need help getting back to Cur's Tooth?
					Yes please
					Alistair explains that he's meeting Tarik later
						Turns out the gold she stole was going straight to him
							Thumb removed for stealing from a nobleman
		The two head back over the bridge
	Back with the rest of the party
		Investigating the ruins of Patia's workshop
			Iris and Tetron look it over
				What they can surmise
					Definitely arson
					Fire started from above
					Viola: Iris, what was the roof made of?
						Reinforced iron
						Dafuq?
					It's all just slag now...
					And, given how much heat was required to do this, it's odd that the surroundings are find
			Should we ask the neighbors?
				Tetron goes to a nearby home
					She was asleep when it started, and then there was a bright light
					Didn't feel any effect from it
					Other neighbors came out too
						There was a clear line where the effect stopped
					Iris asks if she saw anyone that were around prior
						Two individuals
						She didn't get a good look at them
					As an aside, Tetron pulls out his portrait of the Bains
						She likes them
		Okay, we really should find Alistair
			Tetron reallocates a spell for Sending
				Meet us at New Codwin
	Alistair crosses back to Andoran
		The girl's going on ahead
			Does Alistair want to be let in?
		Alistair receives the message
			Responds that he'll come later, have to meet the butcher and go to Cur's Tooth
	Back at the party
		Bruh
		We see Alistair approach because we're in the same area as the butcher's
			Her name is Illia
			He tells us that he doesn't want us to come
				Meeting contacts
				Probably about an hour
				Viola: Keep an eye out for Borgon
			Alistair: Bellflowers are aware of the Kaulfields now
				Iris: Ah, good that you made contact
			Alistair and Illia leave
		Iris: Could we go to the Bellflowers?
			Sure
	At the C&T Warehouse
		We see folks leaving as we approach
		State of manage chaos
		They're surprised to see Iris
			And surprised that she brought friends
		Chatting about Iris's "family reunion"
			"Lots to do to ensure that our facilities remain intact"
		Iris: What can I do?
			Did you hear anything from Patia?
				Yup
				Also investigated the workshop
		Iris says that she heard about the Great Eye and Murkback Keep asks
			Great Eye is an observatory
				Used to be good for predictions before Aroden died
			Many folks manning Kurkback Keep went on an expedition and have not returned
				It's been a fucking month
	Alistair at Cur's Tooth
		They're let in
		Seems like the guards are more there to keep stuff from coming out
		First thing noticed: air so acrid that it stings
		Second thing noticed: Smells of piss, shit, and rot
			People lying along the streets
			Leprosy rampant
		Illia suggests that Alistair hold his breath if he gets queasy
		It's tight
		They enter a "normal" house and descend a ladder
			There's a girl on the bed
				The one from before
			Other individuals
				Person dressed head-to-toe in dark garments, smelling of herbal smokes
					Rubbing medicinal ointment on the girl's wound
				Masked and cloaked person watching
					Illia refers to this person as "Candle"
				Surrounded by kids and teens, most of whom are missing one or more fingers, is Tarik
					Illia introduces Alistair
						She asks if Alistair is okay to shake hands
							Sure
					He's a hobgoblin
					Calm and evaluative
					He asks Alistair's forgiveness for demanding the handshake
						Dude only has three fingers on one hand and is missing the other
		Tarik acknowledges Alistair's meeting with the first girl from the alley and the thumbless girl
			He finds it interesting that Alistair has come from so far and is immediately looking to speak with him
			Alistair explains that he finds it helpful to connect with info dealers and underworld leadership when arriving in new places
				He asks what Tarik knows about the Kaulfields
					He doesn't know anything about them, but he's interested in hearing
						Alistair tells the story
						Given that he doesn't know about them, it eliminates multiple areas of the city
						Since they're nobles, they could be hiding with one of the houses in Vaylen Park
							Also a part of Roaring Hall barred to the public
							Murkback Keep has also been largely vacated, so someone could hole up there
				He asks if Tarik knows about Amos Olgir (and his kidnapping)
					Dude knows Amos, surprised that he got captured
						Did smuggle work for Tarik in the past
					Alistair mentions the connection to Aegis Coalition
						He knows about the Coalition presence in the Keep
						Greyguard Keep is heavily fortified
						Likely in the castle
						Religious affiliation means that they could be using Quickfall Abbey, which used to be dedicated to Aroden
							Attempts to repurpose the building after his death have failed
				Is there a way to cross the river in secret?
					Usually reserved for "stoats"
					He warns that things are different from how they are in Almas: his influence is mostly limited to Cur's Tooth
					Dam north of the city than can be carefully walked across
						Definitely not intended for crossing
						Monitored at night
							Crossers are shot on-sight
				Is there anything Alistair can help with?
					While Tarik thinks, Alistair offers to help train Tarik's kids with stealth
					Could look out for certain medical supplies
						The lizardfolk healer has a list
					He does say that Alistair has already done quite a lot for him
		The lizardfolk finds Alistair's health interesting
			He pulls out his supply list and hands it to Alistair
				Alistair has heard of some of the things on here, mostly herbs
				But the ones that are most important are not known to him
		As Alistair leaves, someone mentions meeting tomorrow meeting
	Alistair emerges from Cur's Tooth
		He prestidigitates himself after he leaves
		He heads to rejoin the party
	Full party
		Alistair reports what he's learned
		Discussing the various things we learned
			Everything's on the Taldan side
	To the IMG!
		Their office is at the Port Authority
			It's busy, but we are seen in short order
			Viola says we're here for Adept LAP certification
				Scheduling...
				They were apparently waiting on a third team
					Person goes to consult another
					They message the other participants
					The two other teams are available
					We can leave today to the testing site
						Viola: We kind of have a ticking timebomb...
							Olgir situation, Kaulfield situation
					Tetron: Could we skip this pass and do this later?
						If we skip and another group fills the first slot...
							Other groups have been waiting for a few weeks already
							Viola: We need to do this now
								Could still coordinate with the other groups regarding scheduling
				Other groups:
					Silver Squires (group of 4)
					Bucket Brigade (group of 7)
				Given sheet listing expectations
					[be sure to put the image on the wiki]
				We have a few hours before departure
					Shopping trip!
	Leaving town
		Three adventuring parties and proctors
		Silver Squires look pretty prepared
			Half-orc woman of the group has the symbol of Iomedae emblazoned on her breast plate
		Bucket Brigade are kind of hodgepodge
			They don't really look dressed for adventure
			But they're confident
			Basically seven Zaknos/Nilbogs
			But they're dragging along a large sack
		We stop for the night next to a wooded hillside
			Inactive portal
			The half-orc Iomedaen approaches Krug and shakes his hand
				They wish each other good luck
			Alistair looks for some of the herbs on the list
				He only finds the super common stuff
			We hear noise from one of the other tents
				Revelry and celebration among the Bucket Brigade
					Tetron listens for a while
						Random bullshit about fucking a troll
						They talk about something "in the beginning" and they don't give a shit about it
							"Third time's a charm!"
						Tetron suggests that it might be worth asking them about how the trial works
					One of the Bucket Brigade pranks the others by grabbing a skunk and using it to spray into their tent
			Iris goes up to the Iomedaen
				It's her second time, but she's Adept-certified individually, which was a different trial
			Schedule for tomorrow: Silver Squires, Radiant Dawn, then Bucket Brigade
	Sleep time
		An hour or so before dawn, Viola awakes to hearing something outside
			It's quiet and muffled
			Viola exits the tent and investigates
			She comes upon one of the Bucket Brigade in a tree "meditating"
				One of the proctors berates them for being out of the tent
				Viola goes back to sleep
Sunday morning
	The teams cast lots
		Can choose an "element" and an "obstruction" for opponents
		Silver Squires give Bucket Brigade heavy gravity and fire
		Radiant Dawn give Silver Squires confusion and water
		Bucket Brigade give Radiant Dawn heavy wind and air
	We each receive an envelope with instructions
	Two hours free time while Silver Squires go
		Tetron offers Haste and Longstrider
			Alistair, Krug, and Iris
		Iris preps her scrolls
	Into the Triune Hall
		Planning chamber
			Large set of doors leading out
				Spectral figure standing in front of them
				Text inscribed above
					We can proceed and forfeit use of this room
			We are in front of stations
			Discussing
				We sort out the phrases based on rhyming scheme and location
				We ask the spirit proctor what to do
					Read the completed poem
					We get multiple chances
				Viola reads it as he had already discussed
					Wasn't correct, so we swap the third-to-last and last lines
			Arcane shackles release from our feet
				We can proceed to the next room
					We must all leave as one group, and the door shuts and locks behind us
						Impossible to pick
		Hall beyond
			Vents along its length
			Central chamber with a grooved pedestal and filled with gas
				What is the gas?
					Not magical
					Not thick enough to obstruct vision badly
				Around the pedestal with some kind of chant that cuts off before finishing
			Alistair can hear something moving in a different room
				Sounds like sliding and smashing stone
			Krug sticks his hand into the fog
				It's fine
				He steps in, holding his breath
					It stings a bit
					He releases
					It hurts
			Alistair holds his breath and plunges in
				His cloak makes it so that he can't depress the pedestal
				Krug goes to step on the pedestal
					The smoke clears
			Tetron takes Krug's spot so he can head ahead with Alistair
		Alistair and Krug arrive at a new chamber
			Two large crystalline constructs patrolling
			They report back since Krug can only hold his breath for 54 seconds
		Tetron: What if we step off?
			The room fills with gas again
		Could we bop the constructs and have them hold down the buttons?
			Krug can lure them
			He runs in to throw a rock
INITIATIVE
	Krug has 9 rounds of air
	Round 1
		Tetron delays
		Alistair delays
		Construct 1 tries to suck Krug toward it, but he holds firm, so it approaches him and swings its arm at him (crit)
			Krug resists some kind of effect
			Krug loses 1 round of air
		Construct 2 also fails to suck Krug
		Iris delays
		Krug raises his shield, then gets the hell out of dodge, taking a smack along the way
		Viola steps back and prepares a tumble
	Round 2
		Tetron delays
		Alistair delays
		Construct 1 approaches down the hall
		Construct 2 approaches down the hall and is held up by construct 1
		Iris moves onto the pedestal to get visual on one of the constructs and analyzes it to create a weakness, then tries to learn about their defenses
			[DEFENSES TO BE ESTABLISHED LATER]
