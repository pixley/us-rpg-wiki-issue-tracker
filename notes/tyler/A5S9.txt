Sunday evening, Black Pit Tavern
	Pre-Kaulfield battle planning and prep
		Iris has Heroism, Tailwind, and Animus Mine all ready to cast on entry
		Iris has a scroll of Disintegrate loaded into her Retrieval Belt
			Tetron has Disintegrate prepared as well
		Iris will carry a scroll and potion in her hands as she steps in
		Tetron gets his hands on a couple of scrolls of Humanoid Form
		Viola asks Iris whether she'd prefer the taunting and such to be toned down
			Iris: Do what it takes to ensure they die, and don't worry about kill-stealing
		Iris warns that the Kaulfields have a retinue
			She does plan to give the slaves an opportunity to stand down
		Tetron: We kicking the door down, or do you want to talk first?
			Iris: I'd like to give them a piece of my mind first
	Entry
		Iris locates the ornate extradimensional door, as the key reveals it
		Order: Iris, Krug, Viola, Alistair, Sloane, Patia, Tetron
		We step inside to see a fine but not opulent hallway
		A door just next to the stairs opens as we finish filing in
			A friendly-looking Tien man wearing an apron steps out
				He has a magical collar across his neck and down his arms
					Tetron is able to identify the collar as one that attaches an individual to a particular house
						Many varieties, but this one in particular seems to be charged with some offensive spell
				He wasn't expecting company
					Iris greets Guangxi by name, confusing him
						"Are my parents in?  And my grandmother as well?"
		The conversation between Iris and Guangxi draws out another individual, who seems to have been folding linens
			They immediately recognize Iris and scans the rest of us
			"The Kaulfields aren't seeing guests tonight."
				Iris says that she doesn't expect that they would, but she has some catching up to do
			They lean in toward Iris and warn that if we're here to fight, we need to spread out, otherwise we need to leave
		Tetron uses his Humanoid Form
		Footsteps and drips are audible
			A knife-twirling individual appears at the top of the stairs
				She notices all the people downstairs, then shoots a glance to her left
		Iris moves past Nithbis, giving them a look of "do what you need"
			"You know I am compelled"
			Iris responds with a disappointed look
		We hear a thud from the garden
		Revana emerges at the top of the stairs
		Eligor comes in from the garden wet and naked, accompanied by a fourth slave
			Iris has never seen her father this concerned
		Rangda opens a door from the terrace at the opposite end of the hall from Eligor
			She's smug as shit
			She's the first to speak
				"Oh, look what crawled in from Cur's Tooth..."
		Eligor to Iris: You look well.
		Ravana: What a handsome group you found!
		Rangda: I imagine you have some trite little speech
			Iris hopes that they all know why she's here and what she's here for
		Ravana laughs with delight, which clearly bothers Eligor
			"Do your best, dear."
