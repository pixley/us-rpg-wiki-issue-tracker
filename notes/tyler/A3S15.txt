Moonday Morning
	Alistair had asked Tetron to quiet the whispering tome the night before
		Tetron just put a pillow over it
	Viola heads to the theater to rehearse
		Blocking memorization
		This takes the whole work day
	Tetron goes to sell the spellbook he found
		He had finished learning the spells in it
	Krug contributes to helping Prig build her temple for the day
		Nilbog tags along
			For support
			And trying to hire labor
				He finds a crew of laborers who have been affected by the lack of lumber work
				He hires 5 for three weeks
	Zaknos is whisked away by Amos
	Tetron offers tutoring to upperclassmen
		Gets 8 silver
	Alistair trains with his siblings
		Notices that he hadn't seen Mouse
			She comes in partway through, looking somewhat disturbed
				Alistair asks what's wrong
				She heard an interesting rumor
					She was on her way to tell the Greencloaks
					She asks him to talk privately
					She asks if he knows about the Macera family
						He says he knows of them
					One of their shipments got siezed the other day
						A lot of the people on that ship have left town or at least quit their jobs
					When she went to learn more, she saw someone from their family torturing someone
						She got the hell out as soon as she realized what she was seeing
					He asks if this is something that should just be reported to the guards
						She asked about it (could be decent leverage), but the Greencloaks are still discussing it
					He asks why the ship was siezed
						There was some sort of illegal shipment
						Something in large opaque bottles
						The military must know
					He says that he'll let her know if anything else comes up
						The party runs across weird enough stuff
					She asks him to watch out
						Timberfell is a really uncomfortable place to be right now
							On that note, he asks where to find Mateo (can he be found there?)
								He hasn't been seen, even though other Clutch members have been seen plenty
								Could just be keeping junior members low?
								She hopes that this doesn't get violent
									He reassures her
									She offers her assistance
					She says that she needs to go calm down
						He says that she should definitely rest
				Note: Alistair knows that Mouse isn't easily rattled...
	Tetron decides to pay a visit to a magic candle shop
		Looking for Candle of Revealing and Candle of Truth
		Success
Moonday evening
	We decide to go to an Arcadian steakhouse
		Tetron takes the opportunity to listen in on high society folks
			Has "he" proposed yet?
				No
				She wants an enchanted diamond and supply has driven price up
				An entire shipment of enchanted diamonds siezed
				Speaking caution advised
					Maceras not around, though, so probably chill
			Over a 100 pp and an estate donated in Easthill
				Thought he was settling down, but he's religious
				Headed for Oppara
			Event coming up
				Day of the Inheritor
				Why attend Day?
				There's a ball on the day for high-society types
				Iomedae-worshippers are dumb
				Going to show off dress
				Might be good to show off in the common event to help public opinion of the wealthy?
					Nah, fuck the poor
			Alistair listens too
				Two gossipy women and a bored husband
					Halfling slave shipped in from Oppara, owner is dashing
					New play
						Absolute mockery of the source material
						Analogy for wealthy people being bad
						Don't support plays put on by Edgewater
					Someone captured other day
						Was walked into Cerulean Keep
						Nearly naked with jet-black hair (probably Chelaxian)
						Dude was shredded
		Meanwhile, Nilbog listens in on the waitstaff, suspecting that they're being racist
			Instead, they're talking shit about us being underdressed
			He goes to get water for us because the server hasn't been by lately
		Alistair checks to see if the silverware is real silver
			It is
		Viola can't get a mixed drink because the place is too fancy
		More listening on Tetron's part
			If the man doesn't get a diamond in the next few months, it could be a problem
			Apparently, someone is buying up a ton
	Back to the inn
		A note had been slid under the door for Krug
			The shield features a shining sword
			Contents (paraphrased):
				"Zae and I are preparing to head west tomorrow morning.  It's quite early, so don't feel like you have to rush to catch up.  We're praying at Lambent Meadow.  We heard you were heading in that direction.  Please meet up with us on the return trip. -Ennis"
			Viola: How'd they know we were here?
				Krug suggests that it might have been Varuk
		Tetron asks Nilbog if he wants to go halvsies on a Decanter of Endless Water
			He notes Nilbog mentioning the holy water thing
			Nilbog is down
		Alice and Fleche knock on the door
			Fleche wants another a story
				Specifically one about the ugliest monster we've ever seen
				Krug jumps in, about the Skittermound
					Ankhegs
					He shows off his shield
			Alice appreciates the company
				Fleche has been antsy with Amos having to work late hours
				Why does a story about a scary monster help Fleche go to sleep?
					Alice: She's weird
						Viola assures Fleche that the whole party is weird
						Alistair insists that he's not weird
							Tetron teases him
			Tetron pulls out one of the magic sugar cubes to show to Fleche
				MAGIC SUGAR?!
				Alice requests that she only gets one
				As Tetron explains how it works to Alice, Fleche fuckin shoves it in her mouth
					This is okay, right?
				He gives Alice more to take home
			They wish us good night
Bedtime!
	Alistair uses his disguise kit to lightly scribble on Tetron's forehead
		And he is maximum stealth
		He writes the word "stupid"
Toilday morning
	Breakfast and daily prep
	Krug: Is Tetron feeling stupid today?
		He noticed when he got up
		And he's letting Alistair have this
		Tetron asks if Taranis noticed
			Taranis is zoned out and looks haggard
			After a moment, he responds that he didn't notice Alistair
	Tetron goes to ask Cyrus about Taranis's condition
		He prestidigitates the "stupid" off
		He finds Cyrus and Namira prepping the reinforced cart
		Namira greets him and says it's earlier than they expected
			She takes over for Cyrus so he and Tetron can talk about Taranis
		Tetron explains the situation to Cyrus
			Taranis clearly hasn't been preening, so he looks kind of scraggly
			Cyrus does a thorough inspection
				Including magic tests
				10 minutes pass
				Cyrus asks if Tetron has acquired any weird magic stuff, some kind of aura?
					Taranis appears to be in good health
					Tetron tells him about the spellbook he stole from the Chelaxian captain
						Hasn't affected him or Alistair, though
				Taranis's eyes are dry and red
					No cold or extreme altitude?
				Tetron asks Taranis what he thinks
					Nah, shouldn't be related to recent activity
					He mentions an irritation in his eye
					Able to go to sleep and wake up the next morning, but definitely not restful
			Cyrus looks through some materials at his desk
				"This is going to sound odd..." Have we made great enemies of anyone?
					Probably, yeah, recently
					But not personally him
					Of the members of the party, Taranis's DCs are the lowest
						Could be someone targeting the party?
						Tetron remembers a moment when we were involved in the Tessra vs Marcellus stuff
							He saw someone who noticed Viola sleeping with her eyes open and hat off
							Also, some variant of scrying allows one to view from the perspective of someone unconscious
							He realizes that this means that someone has been watching him while he sleeps a bunch of the time
					Tetron thanks Cyrus
					Cyrus suggests that Taranis gets some better rest on the wagon while travelling
						Anything to help him sleep
							He has some hawk headcovers handy
			Cyrus offers to hang onto Taranis until we leave
				No thanks
	Tetron gets back to the inn and calls for a private meeting
		Tetron thanks Alistair for writing "stupid" on his head
		No Zaknos (Chimpy)
		He validates that no one else has any secret friends
		He relates what he's realized
		He intends to have Taranis wear a head cover while he sleeps
		Tetron considers whether there's a professor we could talk to
			His old professor (male), Ledrun, covers sorcery
		Viola: We could leave them rude messages
			Tetron: Better idea, we could mislead them as to where we are or what we're doing
				Viola: Could we use illusion?
					Tetron: My spell doesn't last long enough
		Tetron considers that Taranis could use the pocketwatch of awakening
Time to head to turtle quest!
	We arrive at the Grate, the western gate out of town from Tamuth
	Namira is driving
	Taranis eventually sleeps
Through the Freelands
	Farmland, fences and gates, redistributed plantations
	Alistair knows that things are less law-driven here, with disagreements just settled between the parties
	Looser lifestyle
	We eventually pass a dilapidated stone wall that marks the end of the Freelands and the beginning of the wilderness
	Krug brings up the letter
		Viola wonders if the locations is in the Pellsieve
			It pulls up, but as "Swordbreaker Fields"
		Might be connected to the Day of the Inheritor
		Viola is excited
	Tetron says that we should try to keep our adventuring to the city
		Viola suggests that once he figures out the teleport spell, we wouldn't have to do overland travel
	Viola asks Nilbog if he could help with a religious matter
		He's listening
		The deterioration of the statue in the Everflowing Cavern is weighing on her
			Why?
				It feels so tangible
		She feels like it might be worth reaching out to Alseta to see if she can help us help her
We pass the Swordbreaker Fields
	We see two figures in white, facing away from us
		One medium-size with red hair, one small-size with wavy blue hair
	They're sitting on prayer mats, doing some kind of prep
	We pause so Krug can greet them
		They do hear us approach
		The gnome approaches us
			She's got freckles
			It's not time yet
			"I didn't know you were bringing a whole group!"
			She acknowledges that "a mutual friend" pointed her in our direction
			"Your adventuring party is so big!"
			Krug introduces us
			She is Zae Winterblossom, cleric of Iomedae
			Does Ennis want to say hi?
				Zae shouts for him
				She introduces Ennis
				She, Ennis, Keren, and Krug fought together at Lastwall
		Ennis heads back to continue pruning the growth around the cave entrance
		Zae says that what they're doing is important for the Day of the Inheritor
			It's her first year doing it
	Alistair, while scouting, sees a group of merchants
		They don't see our wagon and ask if Alistair needs help or has guardians
		They ask where we're headed
			Claes, we have a quest
			They've been coming from that way
			Alistair asks if the roads are clear
				Yes, but that's weird
				Alistair mentions that we're a LAP
				There's usually bandits and stuff after their seafood haul
					It's been too quiet
		Alistair rejoins us
			Reports what the merchants said
			Suggests that the bandits might be the ones gathering up for the turtle heist
			Tetron thinks on it
				Claes's primary trade goods are shellfish and fish
					It's vital to their economy
					Also important for Almas, because fishing around the city is heavily regulated
Making camp
	Tetron checks on Taranis
		Better rested, woke up part way through the journey and finally preened himself
			Not quite recovered, but in much better shape
	Tetron asks Krug to tell us more about his friends
		They taught him a lot about how to fight and do right
		He met them when he ran away from home, and they took him in
		Alistair notes that fighting in Lastwall means they fought undead... could they also have fought devils?
			Krug says that tapping them could be a great idea
	Watch schedule:
		Zaknos and Namira
		Tetron and Cyrus
		Viola and Krug
		Nilbog and Alistair
Night of Toilday
	Namira is able to keep Zaknos on-task
	Tetron checks to make sure that Taranis is sleeping soundly
		He is
	Cyrus has a question
		He knows that Tetron doesn't use Taranis in combat, but if something were to happen, would he have a new familiar of the same species
			Tetron wouldn't make a Taranis 2
			He'd consider something with more combat utility
				But Taranis has lots of utility and is a great companion
				It's a reset at that point
		Cyrus acknowledges that Taranis was a huge help during the War for the Crown
			That's why Tetron tries to keep him out of battle
		Tetron: How does Cyrus see his familiars in that regard
			Obviously, he only takes care of ones from the department, but having to let one go and get a new one is hard
			Not sure what he'd do with one of his own
	Tetron and Cyrus smell a faint odor on the breeze
		Slight sting to it
		Tetron wakes Taranis
			Can he smell that?
				Yes, smells faintly of iron, probably blood
			Investigate?
				Yes, stay high, come back at first sign of danger
	Taranis comes back
		Found a deceased individual, approx 1 mile
			Cause of death: acidic attack
				Cyrus immediately pulls out a bestiary
					He asks if there were other wounds
						Yes, a large gash
					He says nothing in the area matches those kinds of attacks
				Several days old
	Krug and Viola are up
		Krug can smell the smell, but Viola can't
		Krug and Viola discuss the nature of the eye-scrying
			Viola notes that the only enemy that we made by the time that Tetron saw her sleeping with her eyes open in the Tessra cave would be the Aegis Coalition
				Krug: Unless it wasn't an enemy
					Viola: IT'S FARLEIN
						HE CAN TELEPORT A HOUSE
			Krug wishes we had something like Zaknos's spider thread but for this
				Viola: We could use it to tell if we move stuff off our faces
					Krug: But then they would know that they would know
	Nilbog and Alistair
		They both smell the smell
		Nilbog complains that last watch is just waking up early
Wealday morning!
	Alistair jumps the gun, asking if we can go see the body
		Viola: We need morning prep
		Zaknos can go
	Alistair and Zaknos tracking
		Zaknos botches his investigation, suggesting that a rhino did it
			And has no idea where dude was going or coming from
		Alistair immediately checks for himself
			Dude had been staking out here for a while
			Dude is a poor, middle-aged man, likely a highwayman
		Alistair: Maybe it's not that the bandits are after the turtle, but something else is eliminating them
		Dude didn't leave anything valuable
	They return
		Everyone dismisses the acid-rhino hypothesis
		Alistair reports what he actually saw
			Looks like dude got wrecked in short order
			Might have been a mage due to the acid?
				Viola: Mages don't really do the whole goring through something thing...
			Nilus says that nothing around here does anything remotely like that
Arriving at the research camp near Claes
	Teleportation circle, tents, scientists, magicians
	Person-in-charge: Head Scientist McGee
		Tetron chats with him about the strategic situation
Distributing between the beaches
	Tetron asks Nilus what his opinion is about what the most likely landing point for the turtle is
		Likely won't be the middle beach
		If the turtle is feeling rushed, it'd go to Long Ocean, otherwise the rocky outcropping
		How to encourage it to go to middle?
			Make obstructions
	Split:
		Alistair and Nilbog at Beach 3 (rocky peninsula)
		Krug and Tetron at Beach 2 (straight beach)
		Viola and Zaknos at Beach 1 (sandy bend)
	Zaknos sets up his thread at Beach 2
	Alistair notices that the fish there are making themselves scarce
		Hiding among the coral, low activity
		He hides among the rocky outcroppings
	Nilbog covers himself in seaweed to hid on the beach
	Tetron messages the other beaches
		Viola reports seeing some footprints, perhaps fishing activity?
		Alistair reports about the fish being spooked
			Tetron asks Nilus
				If it's not in the water, could be something aerial
				Could also be in regards to water quality
					Tampering?
	Namira and Cyrus bring the cart over near beach 2
		Namira notes that she smelled more of the stingy smell
			Krug: Could it be what's scaring the fish?
				Tetron: Might be close to Beach 3
			Tetron: How good is turtle sense of smell?
				Great
			Tetron messages Viola to let her know that Beach 1 is most likely candidate
			Namira: Something's not right
				Not even any sign of the poachers...
	Tetron takes the time to swap spells
		See invisibility coming in
		Afterward, he goes ahead and casts it
			Up above, an invisible floating eye
				One over each of beaches 1 and 3
				Tetron heads over to beach 3 and flings a rock at its eye
					Fucking whiffs it
					Eventually poinks it after the fifth rock
					Then he heads over to beach 1 to do the same
	Viola: Since we know they're here, might as well call them out
		Tetron: Need to wait for turtle, don't want it to arrive while we're fighting
	Tetron: Since no eye at beach 2, they might be there
		Krug follows him into the woods there
	In the woods
		Krug and Tetron discover a pair of men looking into local flora
			They notice them, ask for their names
		Tetron instead asks if they've seen anyone suspicious
			No
		Krug: You should leave until it's safe
			Can't.  Waiting for the turtle.
			Krug: Still dangerous, poachers afoot
				Don't believe they're dangerous anymore
				Wat
					There were 15.  They won't 
		Introduce themselves as: Baron Sarram Bain and Lord Kyphon Bain, father and son
			Tetron recognizes the names: they were neighbors of his mother
		Tetron messages to tell others that suspicious people have been found
		Krug goes straight to asking whether they killed those people
			They admit to it
			They wanted to make things safe for the turtle
		Tetron: What are you studying with the turtle?  Can we help?
			Older man offers a trade: we can have the eggs, but they want the turtle
			They claim it to be a personal study
			Tetron says that he needs to consult with the rest of the party
				Sarram insists that he doesn't need to talk to us
					Keyphan can talk to the rest of us instead instead
		Krug grabs Tetron to create a diversion
			Tetron uses the opportunity of pushing Krug off of him to cast message, telling Alistair to come NOW
	Alistair blows his whistle
		We all run in
		The academic vibe of the men turns to snake-like malice
		We have a tense argument, with Viola and Tetron poking at them
