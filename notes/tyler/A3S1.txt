Still at Kolin's
	We wait for the boat
	Tetron gets water breathing ready
At the site
	Nilbog stays on board the rowboat
	The rest of us dive down
At the bottom
	Zaknos swims off on his own near a sunken crate lid
	Large lobster men and a smaller creature emerge
		The creature speaks Aquan
			Tetron understands: "Intruders!  They are near the sacred box!"
			He responds
				He claims to be super religious and asks to see the sacred box
				Claim is that all of us are missionaries who heard that some divine magic stuff is in the area
				They claim that, as landdwellers, should know what the box is
			They eventually say that it contained the "sacred horass"
				A bowl
				Horass = horse
			They worship the "horass"
Roll Initiative!
	Round 1
		Viola casts prestidigitation (no effect this turn) and swims toward one of the lobster men
		Tetron swims toward the small guy and telekinetic projectiles him, missing
		Krug swims toward one of the lobster men, then swings twice with his scimitar, missing both times
		Zaknos marks the small guy, quick draws his bow (hit), then swims away
		Nilbog can see more dudes among us, but details are not really a thing; he asks to have the boat move and then tries to call out to us in vain
		Alistair swims over to the small guy, shanks him for a crit, then hits again, killing the creature
	Round 2
		Viola swims over to flank with Krug, sustains her prestidigitation, and dueling parries
		Tetron casts triple magic missile at the flanked lobster man
		Krug two-hands his shield and then misses twice
		Zaknos sets the flanked lobster man as his prey, fires and hits twice, then swims farther
		The unflanked lobster moves to flank Krug, then grabs Krug with one of its pincers, crushing him, and Krug is now grabbed
		Nilbog sees blood coming from between two big shapes, he panics
		Alistair swims to flank the one grabbing Krug, then crit-shanks it
		The one between Viola and Krug tries to grab Viola, missing thrice
	Round 3
		Viola feints out her lobster man, hits a finisher on it, then uses dueling parry
		Tetron drains his bonded item to re-cast magic missile, now against the one between Krug and Alistair
		Krug crit-bops the one between him and Viola to death, then smacks the other one, then raises his shield
		Zaknos marks the last one, then kills it with one shot
Aftermath
	Lobster blood murkying the water
	Alistair loots the small guy
		Spear and trident, neither magical
	Tetron goes to fill Nilbog in
		Nilbog can't tell who it is, but since Tetron is swimming casually, he's chill
		Tetron offers to lead the boat to the destination
	We start following the tracks
		There's a dimly lit cave at the end of the trail
		Discussion
			How to handle the enchantment?
				Cover it
				Scoop it up with its crate
				Let Zaknos approach it
Cave approach
	Alistair sneak-swims over
		He can feel a faint current that pulls him up and down
		The light is far back in the cave, and he can't really see anything
		He can hear chanting
			1 voice
		He swims closer to get a better look
			He sees a tunnel that curves upward with a bunch of stalagtites
				The water motion has caused a bunch of sea creatures to get impaled
		He swims back to report
	How to approach?
		Need something to weigh down
			The crate!
		Viola and Krug go get the crate
			It only fits two
	Plan
		Krug holding the box from the outside, Tetron and Zaknos inside
		Alistair strong enough swimmer, going first
		Viola using the crate lid to protect from the stalagtites
Execution
	Alistair activates his bracelet of dashing and swims through easily
	Viola donks repeatedly against the stalagtites
	Box trio advances slowly
In the cavern
	Alistair doesn't find much of a place to hide
		He's caught by the chanter
		Two of the small guys, one shark with arms and legs (it has a weapon with an axe on one end and a poky thing at the other), huge chanting manta ray
	We can see imagery of horses all across the cave walls
	Three mirrors amplifying the images
Roll Initiative!
	Box trio delayed

		Shark man moves to flank Krug, then hits on the second of two attacks

		Tetron sustains the animated assault on the manta guy, then drops another one on it, shark man, and small guy 1
		Small guy 1 approaches Alistair and then misses twice
		Small guy 2 stabs at Zaknos three times, only hitting the first

	Nilbog intermission
		It's been a while, so he asks the dudes on the boat with him to try swimming down to get us
		He can see sea creatures chowing down on the chum we made
	Round 4
		Alistair is affected by the bowl, so he swims too

		Zaknos is still enraptured by the bowl, and he starts to swim past the manta
	Nilbog intermission
		Dude can't see shit or swim for shit
		Nilbog asks if he's sure
		Dude gets saltwater in his eyes, and he says that the dolphins might have gotten us
		Nilbog sticks his head into the water to try to look, but he can't see shit either
	Round 5

The small guys surrender
	They start to flee
	Tetron gives them electric arc as a parting gift, killing them both
	Loot
		Chained rock
			Reflective
			Tetron determines that it's a slab of low-quality quartz
			It looks heavy
		Three full-length mirrors
		There's gold afoot, with some barricaded underneath some big logs
			250 gp
		Krug and Alistair break it open
			There's a small nook with stuff inside
				Marble altar with a gold-inlaid porcelain base
				Staff of silver and jade, non-magic
				Some sort of headwear, non-magic
	The up-and-down current is gone
	We start moving the loot
		Mirror and a bowl first
We surface for the first time, to Nilbog's relief
	He jumps in, relieved
	More loot movement, taking an hour or so
We arrive back via the Drink
	As opposed to Oldtown, which is where we left from
	Alistair volunteers to find a buyer while we figure out how to transport the stuff subtlely
		He goes to Zaugia's to ask for a recommendation
			Rebel's Rest, one of Zaugia's folks
	Female goblin with large ears greets Alistair
		She's down with the loot
		We hand the stuff off
Back to Kaolin's
	We tell her that a cult had formed around it
		She doesn't even comprehend that
	Payment: 100 gp
