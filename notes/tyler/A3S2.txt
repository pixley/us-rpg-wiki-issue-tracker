----

Moonday Afternoon
	Boat leaves around 7
	Splitting up: Alistair, Viola, and Krug to Zaugia's; Tetron, Nilbog, and Zaknos to find new spells to learn
Zaugia's
	Virok stops us, asking what we want
		Viola says they're there to give an intel update
		Zaugia lets us in
	Info dump
		Viola admits that Zaugia was totally right about the Aegis Coalition
		Ten years of operations
			Hired Cedrog and Kreed to kill Tessra's mom
			Trying to eliminate Alseta worship
				Because that will bring back Aroden somehow
		Alistair reports that Sloane vanished
			Also Zven has been "terminated"
			Zaugia tracks when Sloane vanishes
				Generally gone no less than a week
				Alistair posits that she may go to and from another city
				Viola mentions that the AC is probably up to something in Almas
		Alistair asks about the state of the Almas underground in the month+ he's been gone
			[LUYOU DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE FULL RESPONSE]
			In the wake of Dorfinn's capture, the Almas Thieves' Guild has dissolved
			Multiple operations have risen to fill the vaccuum, often more extremist
				Limited areas of operation, since Almas is a tough city to steal in
				They aren't afraid of causing injury and the like, unlike Dorfinn
	She has connections in Almas [TO BE NAMED AT A LATER TIME]
	Viola thanks Zaugia for the time and the help, and tells her that we're leaving for Almas
Spell shopping
	Tetron looking for less-than-savory spellbooks, used, likely from a passed magician
		Arcana check to know where maybe he could find that sort of thing: maybe Drink or Arsenal?  Dunno...
		He decides to ask the fence
			She's still sorting through the shit we pawned
			She mentions a guy deep in The Drink who would sell that sort of thing
				Warning: Tetron is pretty; he should walk with Nilbog to be safer
	Tetron consults Zaknos and Nilbog about how to look less pretty
		Nilbog suggests the bucket hat, Tetron passes
		Does the fence have any tattered attire?
			Likely no, but he could steal clothes off nearby clotheslines
		Decision: traveller's robes, let Nilbog lead
	To The Drink!
		Doesn't feel as dangerous in broad daylight, but Tetron does still stand out a little
			No imminent feeling of being mugged
		Winding path to a door with purple hands, and the handle itself is also an open hand
			The handle feels fleshy, and it lightly grasps back
		The building feels like the sort that was built in the slightly-too-small gap between two pre-existing buildings
			Lots of questionable wares on the shelves
			In a chair, a white dome, and a fancy black dress
				She has a cool skull mask thing, but she talks all creepy
			Tetron asks about spellbooks, placing his hand on the table
				REFLEX SAVE?! He pulls his hand away before the proprietor puts her hand on his
			She gestures over to a section of the store that has a selection of books, among various preserved... um... parts
				Tetron says he's happy to just browse himself
				She stares at Tetron the entire time
			Zaknos starts chatting up the proprietor
			Nilbog browses religious books
				A whole bunch of them are leather-bound
				One of them has a hand emblazoned on the cover
				He's put off
			Tetron finds a spellbook, kind of creepy cover, but the spells within
			As Tetron checks out, the proprietor asks Zaknos out for tea later
				They say that they're leaving, but Zaknos would be happy to join her if we're ever back in town
		After departure, Tetron apologizes for how creepy the place was
Reconviene along the way to the Fleet District
	New split
Krug and Nilbog go to the Sarenrae temple for one last prayer before leaving
	Nilbog praying about how he was "smited" back in the mines
		He considers how uneasy he felt in the shop, including a weakened connection to Sarenrae
		He keeps seeing a hungry look in Tetron's eye as he was purusing the shop
	Krug praying
		He feels the noonday sun upon him, a feeling of wholeness
		Not a confirmation of specific approval, but contentment
	Krug finishes praying first
		He notices Nilbog purturbed, which is unusual for the normally-unbothered goblin
		Krug asks what's up once Nilbog finishes
			Nilbog asks what Krug's feelings on Tetron are
				He's pragmatic, and he has the capacity to do a lot of good in difficult situations
				Overall, he hasn't made up his mind
			Nilbog expresses worry about him
				He asks Krug to keep an eye out
					Did he notice something?
						The reading material didn't sit right with him
Viola finds a tailor shop
	She finds a young woman mid-sewing and another figure with elven ears partially obscured
		The woman is Lyn!
	Viola approaches the younger woman and asks for various materials
		Lyn takes her over to the rolls of cloth, and she has a moment where she might recognize Viola
	All the materials are gathered, Lyn is still sus
		Viola checks out and leaves
	Lyn comes out a little bit after Viola walks away
		She stops Viola and asks if she has a sibling
			Viola is an only child
			Lyn seems to accept this - recognition averted
Viola inquires about her mail at the Pretty Prancer
	They came!
Timeskip to the evening!
	Lots of parcels and barrels being loaded onto the ship
	Kaolin's crate also loaded onto the ship
	Amos talking to crewman, with family nearby
	Other passengers around
		Small brunette halfling woman with tight buns
		Human businessman, perhaps a clerk, pondering something while staring out at the ocean
		Pompous-looking gnome with purple hair, wearing Andoren military garb
		Catfolk casually standing in schoolwear?  Has a pipe
	Various crew
		Elderly woman, near-human at least, carrying instruments
		Other folks moving cargo
	Viola waves at Alice and Fleche
		Fleche waves back
	We board
On the Silken Wave
	The gnome, first in line, sprints straight to a room to claim
	Everyone else boards more casually
	A human man in a fine jacket comes down to the passenger deck to introduce
		Captain DeVorge
		We can also contact Officer Kosoko for help
			Will likely be on the main deck soon
		There will be some ports of call, including one stop to restock
	Dinner in the lounge
		Viola gets apple juice with splash of rum
		Kind of low-key in there
		The older woman has set up in the corner
			She pulls out a small instrument: a small harp
			She's an elf
			Mirabel is her name
	Main deck
		Tetron comes up to watch the ship launch
		Alistair there too
		DeVorge giving instructions to a furry creature, doglike when it turns around
			Has a flat nose, it's a shoony!
		The shoony blows a whistle, and an armored hippo-person leaps out of the water
			It's Kosoko
		Captain thanks folks around for patience, wishes the passengers a good trip
			Announces that we're right on schedule
Sailing Night 1
	Tetron tours the ship, Alistair following him around
		Lifeboats suspended off the main deck
		Large fortified crates and other large items in the bulk cargo hold on the way back down
			Lots of them with visible addressing
		Down to the lounge
			Mirabel and a dwarf cook, in addition to Viola
				The cook is short, even for a dwarf
				Mirabel is still tuning
		Passenger deck
			Zaknos is sprawled out on his bed and is talking to himself
			Door to light cargo area
		Tetron retires to his quarters to start reading
	Krug looking out at the water
		Things are calm
		The city of Augustana shining across the water
		He can't help but think of the vision he had last week
			It looks just fine
	After eating, Alistair returns to the main deck
		He counts the people above deck
		He wants to get on that crow's nest
			He waits to see if folks go to bed
	Nilbog is eating
		Roast beef
		Nilbog can't see the cook from behind the counter, but food is shoved to him
			He takes the offer of gravy
		Viola waves as he walks by with his food
	Tetron reading his book
		Which spell first?  Rouse Skeletons.
		As he studies, he realizes that he already knows the spell.
			Seems like all his life
			It isn't already in his spellbook, though
			He's a little off-put by this, but he continues
		Feather Fall next, but he learns it as normal
		He decides to flip through to scan
	Krug contemplating
		He hasn't been at sea before
		Then he goes down for food
	Alistair goes for the crow's nest
		He sneaks past and makes it up
		He uses his hat of disguise to look like he belongs
		He uses his spyglass to look back toward Augustana
			He can see various landmarks he's been to
			Different districts have different amounts of light (Drink and Copperdown are dark)
	Mirabel is done
		As she packs up, she thanks Viola
		She asks Viola to play her viola with her some time when they're free
	Viola returns to the room to find Tetron
		He's sitting on the floor with a book
		Tetron asks if Viola is ready for bed
			Viola doesn't know this, but Tetron is not in control of himself
	Nilbog sneaks into the kitchen
		He wants a little bit of fire to comfort himself about being on a boat
		Then he sneaks back out
	Alistair gets bored after 45 minutes and goes to bed
Sailing Day 1
	Tetron wakes up not having remembered anything after learning Feather Fall
		He's terrified
		He Messages Viola to wake her up
			She's irritated about it
		Tetron asks Viola to not tell anyone
		Tetron explains that he doesn't remember anything
			Viola tells him how their exchange the night before went
			He's confused as to him asking if she's ready for bed
				Viola points out that they've never bunked
		Viola immediately jumps to the possibility that the book is cursed
			"Throw it overboard!"
			Tetron is not interested in throwing it overboard
		Tetron proposes an experiment
			He's going to flip through the book again
			He wants Viola to snap him out of it if he's weird afterward
			He does it, no ill effect
				He admits that this feels like a bad version of the crystal dreams
		In an effort to check for a curse, they detect magic
			Nothing
		Viola presses the point of disposing of the book
			Can't throw it overboard, it might start a cult
			Can't set it on fire, it might release something awful
			Tetron wants the spells anyway, despite Viola's objection
	Krug and Nilbog awake
		Krug notices Nilbog's unease
			He has black on his hand
			He doesn't like being on the boat
	Breakfast time!
		Dining hall is crowded
		Zaknos and Olgirs are absent at present
		We chat a bit
		Tetron announces that he's going to read at the table
			Viola is alarmed
			Krug checks with Nilbog whether that was the book he was talking about
			Viola asks to speak with him privately
				WTF?
				He wants to test
				Viola tells him that he's playing with fire
					He's not fireproof like Nilbog
			Tetron sets the book on his lap and doesn't read it
		Viola announces that she'll be sewing
		Krug presses Tetron
			"Some magic shouldn't be learned."
		Olgirs arrive
			Alice and Fleche go to get food
			Zaknos and Amos approach
				Zaknos claps Tetron on the back and asks if the book is the one he got from the "hands lady"
				Tetron deflects by asking what Zaknos and the "hands lady" talked about
					They're both Nidalese
					But she was disappointed that Zaknos doesn't do any magic

			The Olgirs merge a table with ours
				Amos wants to know more about us
					Game night?
					When no one immediately responds, he chows down
				What kinds of games?
					Card games, telling stories, etc.
					Fleche likes children games, but Amos doesn't play
						Viola chimes in to say that adults can play them too
						Fleche complains that she wants another kid to play with
							Everyone turns to look at Alistair, but he's already ditched the table
	Alistair is on deck, testing casting Spout in the water
		Kosoko approaches, saying that it looks like fun
			He wants to be lifted out of the water
			It doesn't work
			He comes back up
		Alistair asks for a tour
			Kosoko is excited, and he takes him along
			They end up at the steering wheel
				Alistair can't hold it straight
			Through crew quarters and stuff
			Shows a map and explains the ship's course
	Back at the table
		Tetron still not reading
		Amos is stuffed and excuses himself
			He's going to take Fleche updeck to see the ship at work
		Alice is going down to sew
			She's working on a travel outfit for Fleche
			Viola offers to share supplies
				Alice invites Viola to sew together
		Tetron announces that he's going to go study in his room
			Krug tails to keep an eye on him, but Krug isn't exactly the most subtle of people
			Tetron pays him no mind, heading down, but he stays outside his room and keeps an eye out to see if Krug follows
	Nilbog is sus of Tetron
		He wants to position himself above Tetron's room to spy
			He draws on the floor with his charcoal, but he's interrupted by the crew asking him to not do that
			He starts "cleaning"
	Krug makes it down
		Tetron accosts him - "I suspect you're concerned about the book."
			"I'm concerned about you."
		Tetron explains that he really wants to learn the spells to help the team
			He's intending to stay in until dinner
				If he comes out before then, get Viola
	Tetron shuts himself in and starts to read
		Aqueous Orb and Vampiric Touch are learned normally
		He starts flipping through more
	Nilbog can't really see in, and there's nothing to hear
		He's run out of "cleaning" time
		He gives up and slinks off
		He tries to sneak into the kitchen
			He's hit by thrown vegetables that missed the slop bucket
			"How can I help you?"
				He responds by eating the vegetable
				He then claims that he got lost and leaves
	Alistair finishes the tour with Kosoko
		He heads for the heavy cargo area to poke around, but it's guarded
	Viola goes to get Tetron for lunch
		He's just walking out
		Krug accosts us, reporting that this is wrong
			Viola has to double-check
		Tetron is talking weird, so Viola slaps him
		Tetron is still off, so Viola slaps him again
		Krug goes inside to look at the book, it's fucking evil
		Krug and Viola discuss how to rid
			Overboard is right out
			Viola's concerned about evil smoke from burning
			Krug commits to burning it anyway
		Krug and Viola both feel a presence
			Viola succumbs and walks away to rejoin 
			Krug overcomes and forces the door open
			He moves past, straps his bandages to the book, and carries it off
			He blocks Tetron's door with a chair
	Tetron awakens to find himself locked in the room
		He messages Krug to ask what he did
		Krug ignores him
		He explains that he's himself again
		Krug commits to disposing of it
	Krug goes to find Nilbog
		In the lounge
		Krug presents the book, and Nilbog affirms that it is the book
		Nilbog is hesitant to burn it on account of angering some kind of dark god
		Nilbog vents about how he doesn't like Tetron at all
		Krug refocuses on the book - it's contrary to Sarenrae's teachings
			It has undead shit in it
	Tetron still in the room alone
		He mage hands the chair out of the way of the door
		He sprints upstairs
		Other people are around
			Alistair is eating
			Harpist is playing
			Krug and Nilbog are talking amongst themselves
		Tetron walks over to Nilbog and Krug
		Krug asks how Tetron got out
			"I'm a wizard."
		Tetron asks whether we could just decurse the book
		Krug insists that Tetron is still under it's effects
		Alistair read auras: no magic
		Alistair asks to look at the book
			Tetron insists no
			"That's what triggers the curse."
		Tetron insists that it should just be decursed
			He spent all his money
		Krug asks Alistair to get Viola
			Alistair reports that Viola's not in her room
			Tetron says that Viola is under the influence and we should redirect to helping her
			Krug asks Alistair to locate Viola
		Krug offers a compromise
			Tetron stays away from the book, and Krug doesn't destroy it
	Alistair finds Viola, sprinting back
		Zaknos heads after, despite Viola insisting that it's a bad idea
	Viola arrives in the lounge
		She charges up, making a scene, insisting that the book must be destroyed
		Krug says that he wants to have Nilbog use Sacred Fire on it
			Viola is cool with that
			Nilbog has left
				Alistair mentions that he went to the kitchen
		All eyes on us
			Viola adjusts herself, then makes an announcement
				We're the Radiant Dawn
				There is a cursed item
				We're taking care of it
			PANIC
			Guards incoming
	Nilbog panicking in the pantry with the cook
		Nilbog prays for guidance
			He has a vision of the auras of those in the lounge
				The book has a bad aura, but Tetron has an even stronger one
		He gets up with determination
	Back in the lounge
		Nilbog walks out and shrieks to get everyone's attention
		Krug tells him to use Sacred 
	Tetron back in his room
		Taranis is perched on the windowsill
			He needs to tell Tetron something
				He was watching; he noticed Tetron gripping the staff too hard
					He looks down, there's visible indentations
					He brushes it off
			He offers to keep an eye on him
		UNCOMFORTABLE NOTE: Taranis addresses Tetron as "daddy"
	Viola back in the Olgirs' room
		Viola double-checks her work from when she was out: it's as she intended
		Alice asks what happened, and Viola reports about the curse
			The second curse for the party in the last week and a half
			Alice advises that merchants have a tough time with cursed object identification
				They don't want to be identified
	Tetron gets a knock at his door
		The person introduces himself as "Nilus"
			Tetron knew him in college, a catfolk
		He notes that Tetron ran into a bit of "trouble" earlier in the day
		He asks why Tetron's bound for Almas
			Part of a LAP
				Does he like us?  We're competent
					It's a funny question.  Most of them aren't unsavory
					We're had a lot of important tasks put upon us, and he trusts us to carry through
			Nilus says that he's heading in to meet up with other old classmates
				They're getting together for something that requires a bit of travel
				Tetron recognizes some of the names: Namira and Cyrus
					They majored in "care of magical creatures"
				They're going outside Almas for a bit of time to transport a rare magical creature
				Would they benefit from the whole of the Radiant Dawn helping?
					Nilus says that it may be better that it's just them
						He considers us to be rambunctious at times
						Is discretion necessary?  The rest of us are very capable
					Nilus proposes it as a potential out
			Offers Tetron to meet up to chat in his room
			Info on the meetup at the university exchange
		Nilus's last name is Feringray
	Krug and Nilbog meet up
		Nilbog wants to clarify what he meant by saying that the aura he saw was with Tetron, rather than the book
			Krug suggests that they chat with Viola about it
		Krug tells Nilbog that he's proud of how he did during the tense situation
			He credits Krug, since he was able to put his trust in him
		They go to get others
			Viola and Zaknos grabbed first
			Krug has to go find Alistair
				He's easy to find - hanging out on main deck
	Team meeting in Zaknos's room
		Zaknos found in the kid's bed he requested
			He declares that it's not what it looks like
				Viola doesn't even know what it DOES look like
			He's stuck
			Viola helps him out
		Nilbog tells Viola and Zaknos about his vision
			He also rattles on about how he doesn't like Tetron
				Viola insists that the "smite" thing was a joke
		Krug returns with Alistair, who is caught up
		Krug suggests that whatever is up with Tetron isn't his fault
			We should watch him
			We should be accepting of him
