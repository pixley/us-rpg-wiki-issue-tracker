Tetron in Barnes's office
	Barnes tells Tetron that Sebastian has confessed, gotten expelled from Agrimony Point, and is serving jail time
		His uncle was apparently local and paid a visit, convincing Sebastian to cooperate
	Tetron can continue to pay off his fine in any major Andoren city
	News regarding the Tessra thing from Barnes
		Barnes asks what Tetron knows about Arthfell
		Local people near the Lattimer Mines report sounds in the night, large trails/footprints
		Not a functioning mine at present, but worth keeping an eye out
		Arthfell safety tips
			Stick to main roads
			The mines are a way off the main road; there could be cart traffic that went through before, but likely not horse-traversable
		Is it worth bringing horses to begin with?
			Decent distance before heading off main road
		She wishes us good luck
Viola at Dockward Hold
	Zaugia ponders Viola's question
		Zaugia doesn't make a habit of working with people she hasn't had much dealings with
		However, she does know someone outside the city (in Almas)
			Connection to diplomatic envoy from Hold of Belkzen
				Half-elf/half-orc, female
				Baruk Firehair
				Trusted by Zaugia
				Skilled in tracking and combat
				Sarenrae follower
				Wandering around Almas area, perhaps heading to Taldor?
				No guarantee that we can find her
	Zaugia bummed that Krug is religious
	Viola double-checks that the Schwarma Leak is squared away; it is
In the Fleet District, the Red Envelope
	Viola and Tetron haven't arrived yet
	Amos already has a table, accompanied by Alice and Fleche
	Zaknos tries to sneak up on Amos, but he bumps a server and Amos notices
	Jasmine tea and gyoza for the table
	Amos asks how the snargie search went, Zaknos says it was productive
	Amos asks where the "other humans are"; Krug says that we're busy
	Reason for invitation:
		Amos is leaving for Almas the evening of the 31st (Moonday)
		If we're heading there, he'd pay for our fare to accompany him
		Somewhat "luxurious" vessel likely to be taken
		He also wants some company for Fleche, perhaps Alistair?
			"I don't know there's much to do on a ship anyway..."
		Amos mentions that Zaknos was something of a scamp as a child
	Tetron arrives right as orders are taken
	Amos hasn't slept well; late business meetings
	Amos asks what we're doing in the week before the departure
		Trip to the Arthfell
	Amos says that Zaknos's mother would be proud of how well Zaknos is doing with the party
		Zaknos can't mention having checked on her
	Food arrives, still no Viola
	Amos tells us why the family is travelling: they are travelling to a fine art exhibitions
		It's been a lot of his shipments lately
		He's going to supervise the display
		Good opportunity to rub shoulders with influential people from far and wide
		Tetron is aware of the exhibition being a charity event
			Cycles between different hosting organizations
			When growing up, he was sometimes made to go with his mom
	Amos asks what we're going into the forest for
		Tetron says we're helping the mayor
	Zaknos asks why we're invited
		First trip with Fleche, so need to keep her safe
		Amos was planning on travelling on-land to Oppara after Almas
			High border security, "visibility problems", unpredictable tides
			He'd prefer to do the border crossing by lan
	Viola finally arrives and orders
	Where is Amos going after Oppara?
		Perhaps heading back onto the trade route, but depends on how long business keeps him in Oppara
	Viola is told about the trip
		She's tentatively on board
	Amos celebrating Silverglazer before departure?
		Likely.
		Tetron picks up something about the holiday being uncomfortable for Amos
		Silverglazer Sunday is a primarily Andoren holiday that's split between last Sunday of Arodus and first Sunday of Rova
			Focused on water; fishing, etc.
			Also puppet shows
	Amos starts to fall asleep, so his family excuses themselves
To a public bath!
	For Viola, Tetron, and Krug anyway
	Alistair and Nilbog go to bed instead
	Krug goes to a private bath instead on account of needing to remove his bandages
	Zaknos goes for a drink at the Jaw and Mead
Viola, Tetron, and Krug discuss next steps
	They pick up Zaknos, who goes to wake up Nilbog
	Possibility of negotiation with Tessra discussed, worth a shot
	Parleying with Tessra likely to draw Marcellus's anger
	No discussion of the breakfast items around Valin or guide
	Possibility of needing to present egg to Tessra if negotiations go well
Krug has a rough night as some kind of sickness takes hold
	Anxiety and anger
	Wakes up at 2 in the morning
	He gets up and goes to the Sarenraen temple
	The temple is empty of everyone other than a skeleton crew of priests
	He sits and prays
		"Are we on the right path?"
		Mentions restlessness, maybe forgot something he should doing?
		No connection made after 20 minutes, as he can't even get in the right headspace
			Mind filled with old memories of being shoved, taunted, ritually cut, mocked, belittled
		Still sweating
	Someone eventually comes up to check up on him
		Krug's initial reaction is a battle-ready twitch
		They ask if he would like them to pray for him
		He can't even focus on the words of the priest's prayer as he sits there for five minutes
	He heads back to the inn and tries to go back to sleep
		He does go to sleep after about half an hour
Morning!
	Nilbog awakes to find Krug sweating profusely and grinding his teeth
		Wake up attempt
		Krug talks about how the night went
		Nilbog gets water and a washcloth
		Nilbog offers to let Krug sleep in and bring up some breakfast
		Krug just lays in futility
	Breakfast sandwiches
	Nilbog goes back upstairs, delivers the sandwich, and tries to evaluate Krug
		Nilbog remembers the bite that Krug got the other night; that area looks swollen
			He asks about it
			Krug didn't notice; shifts the bandages aside to get a proper look
			Pustules forming on it, looks kind of like a milder version of what Teedum had
			Nilbog gathers supplies (coals, alcohol, rags) to try to treat the infection via cauterization
		Nilbog's treatment is successful
	It's getting awfully close to time, but Krug isn't ready yet
		Viola runs ahead
			Overpays her share of Rae for Tetron
			Checks out
		Tetron goes to get Rae
		Others check out
Viola at Valin's
	Three figures at a table: Valin, an elderly woman with matted dreads and a wolf pelt, and Olorin
	Viola explains the delay
	Guide explains that we should make good time, provided we take some game trails (riding single-file)
	Guide is Kiruka, from Aldek's tribe
		Viola notes how far that is
		Operates in Arthfell area as a guide, translator (Hallit), and envoy
	Others arrive eventually
	Briefing begins
		Valin starts
		We're headed to the Lattimer Mines
			Famous mine in southern Arthfell
		Recent conflict between miners and Lumber Consortium, which is currently in a stalemate
		Tessra seems to be interested in the area, perhaps looking for gatestone?
		Area is likely safe from dangerous creatures, but lots of ambush holes and defensive positions
		Valin posits: we have a guide, so...
		Kiruka continues:
			Marcellus is taking a direct route to the mines' cart entrance
			Kiruka is aware that we're supposed to meet him
			She advises, however, that it's basically a killbox to take that route, so we should instead take a game trail to a cavern that enters the mines from the bottom
		Tetron asks why Marcellus would take the direct route
			He's unlikely to be alone
			Kiruka says he put out word to other towns, and Oregent sent people, including Deadknuckle
			Deadknuckle could be doing this as a PR stunt
			What would Shanks think about Deadknuckle's involvement?
				He knows, he's pissed
		Kiruka knew Selma
			She was generous
			Herbalist for Falcon's Hollow
			She had a previous husband with whom she had a son (half-elf)
				Husband died
			As for Tessra, Kiruka never met the second husband, but the guy had elemental powers
				This got passed on to Tessra
				Goals:
					open nearby gate
			Other gatestone is no longer at Agrimony Point
			They had some leads about the second, but they've fallen through
			You need some kind of sign to open the gate to a destination
				Kiruka knows one or more signs
				She has the other stone
					Olorin says that it is specifically entrusted to Kiruka
					Must be brought back to Olorin or used to open the gate under Andoren control
						Kiruka warns about controlling access to the gates
				Kiruka originally came via a gate on Droskar's Crag
		Olorin checks with Valin whether Marcellus would be a problem
			Valin still considers him his best friend
	Party discusses which route to take
		Pros of direct route
			Helping Marcellus not get himself killed
			Keeping an eye on Deadknuckle
		Pros of back route
			Possibility of peaceful resolution with Tessra
			Ability to set up a flank with Marcellus
			Not getting bopped by angry Deadknuckle
			Not getting bopped by the flying creature
	Word of warning from Olorin:
		Officially, Olorin must remain neutral, but while she works with the Consortium, she is no friend of theirs.
		Be careful around Deadknuckle and "other politicians" (read: Shanks)
		The Consortium has traditionally been at odds with Andoran, even with the recent leadership change
	Kiruka note about the route
		Likely to avoid stationed tribesmen
		Don't let guard down
		Likely scouting parties and warning traps
		She will do her best to lead us true
		Ability to do advanced scouting using local flora and fauna
Heading out!
	Krug feeling increasingly ill throughout the day
	Camp made about 5 miles from the edge of the forest
	Clouds are starting to roll in
	Nilbog stays up all night to treat Krug
		Kiruka gathers herbs to help Nilbog
		It's some strong shit
	Zaknos suggests trying to give Krug something to knock him the fuck out
		Tetron pitches just casting sleep
	Zaknos goes hunting to help make Krug a better meal to feel better
		He finds rabbit
Viola and Tetron on first watch
	Other gatestone not in custody of the conspiracy!
	Bigness of situation potentially means we don't go back to Augustana
		We've wrapped up everything except where the blood magic went
	Plenty of reasons to go to Almas
		Zaugia's contact
		Krug is asleep, so can't tell him now
	Tetron might head to Oppara from there
	Viola muses on going to Cassomir
	Nothing to see
Zaknos and Alistair on second watch
	Zaknos asks whether Alistair liked the orange juice from breakfast (he had paid for it)
		"Sure, Zaknos"
	Zaknos asks Alistair what keeps him so quiet
		"There's not much to say"
	Alistair not looking forward to going back into the woods
	Alistair notices a flying outline above the forest in the distance
		It's sizeable, like a small drake?
		Zaknos suggests getting a closer look, perhaps a bonding experience
			Alistair thinks that's a really bad idea
		Zaknos asks Nilbog whether they should go look
			Nilbog says that Zaknos should go
		Zaknos says maybe he should wake up Viola and Tetron
			"Why did I even tell you?"
		Alistair will keep an eye out in case Zaknos gets into danger
		Zaknos goes to wake up Kiruka
			Her eyes open as he approaches
			Alistair corrects Zaknos's details as he explains
			She warns that it'll take a while to walk the five miles
				Zaknos is only planning on going a little closer
	Zaknos and Kiruka go by foot
		Quietly
		Kiruka notes that it'll sprinkle a bit in the morning
			She explains her abilities, largely to help move and track
			Including granting darkvision to Zaknos
		They come across a large divot where a creature might have nestled into
			They investigate
				Looking for errant scales, potential sleeping places for people
				Zaknos looks carefully into the divot, finding 3 scales of a flame drake native to the area around Droskar's Crag
					They aren't dragons
					They aren't intelligent like dragons
					They're wild, not tameable
					They're territorial
					They usually like near volcanoes, but not unheard of here
					They can see through smoke
					They have a good sense of smell
					They have darkvision
					They speak Draconic
					Immune to fire, paralysis, and sleep
					Weak to cold
					They can attack very quickly
					They bite
					They breathe fire
					If motivated, they can fucking move
					This particular drake is an adult
					Nestling was multiple days ago
				Kiruka found the areas where people were resting recently
			With that, they're done
		Kiruka asks about the fighting styles of the group, in case it helps her help us
			She has goodberry
			Zaknos leads with the whole "missing part of his soul thing"
				Kiruka misinterprets it as "sole"
				Zaknos claims it was a joke
			Zaknos mentions that he's a bit weaker, but Krug being sick means he should probably get the goodberry
			She asks whether Alistair fights
				He does, but doesn't usually take damage
	Alistair still keeping watch alone
		After an hour and a half, the pair return
		Zaknos reports about the flame drake
		Kiruka goes back to sleep
		Zaknos talks about how cool getting darkvision was
Valin and Kiruka on third watch
	Uneventful
Morning
	Krug sleeps intermittently as Nilbog treats him
		He awakes to find Nilbog dozing on top of him
		ALL BETTER!
		He tries to remove Nilbog without waking him
			He slides his arm out successfully
	Nilbog does wake up as the others stir, though
		He's fatigued
	Kiruka mentions what Zaknos found
		Fun
	Let's roll
