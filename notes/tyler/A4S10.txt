Starday, midday
	Cyclops dead on the ground, in the middle of the fucking way
		Cyclops is likely about 150 bulk
		Telekinetic haul can move 80 bulk at a time
			He could levitate the carts instead!
			Tetron will reallocate spells to have it
	While Tetron reallocates
		Alistair looks through cyclops's shit
			Has some kind of massive leather harness thing
				Bits of humanoid corpse is attached to it as trophies
					On them...
						Obsidian ring that seems to have some kind of energy - Shadow Signet
							Spells can target Fort or Ref DC instead of AC
							Tetron takes it
						Soft leather boots with winglets on the heels - Winged Boots
							Auto-cast feather fall
							Goes to Viola
						Bracers - Bracers of Devotion
							Cast focus spell -> shield raise gives resist 10 against evil, plus emergency focus point
							Been on this dead body so long that whatever deity's symbol was on there is long worn away
							Goes to Krug
					He uses mage hand to grab stuff without touching the bodies
		Iris approaches Krug
			She says she has a means to better work together
				She gives him scales from her first ever molt
					It's important to her
				Shared Vulnerability!!!
				Krug awkwardly thanks her
					Iris says that she'll find something less weird if she comes across it
				She mentions that she intends to do this for Viola and Alistair later
					This is an experiment
		Viola approaches Krug
			Got a headache from the psychic attack
				Krug LoHs
	Telekinetic haul!!!
		"Hold on, horses!"
		Krug realizes that he could just carry the horses over
			This would definitely be less traumatizing than levitating them
		The carriages lift up and over
	We notice that the cyclops kind of carved an alternate path through the valley
		Might be fun stuff that way
		Iris suggests that we consult Margot
			She's chill with it
		After an hour, we find a split-off point
			There is a massive cavern
				Cyclops nest inside
					Made out of mushed up bushes and animals
				Several smashed bodies around
					Alistair goes in, since he can hold his breath really well
					Merchants and adventurers
				Items in the nest
					Red-and-gold cape - Cape of the Mountebank
						Bonus to deception, 1-per-day dimension door
						Viola gives up the winged boots to have this
					Small gray vial - Drought powder
						Waterproofs for 24 hours, can lower water level, can slow water-based creatures; consumable
						Tetron suggests Alistair take it
					Large runed shield - Moderate retaliation
						1-per-hour force damage against attacker on shield block
						Goes to Krug
					Also some dust on the ground next to a campfire that isn't ash
						This is moderate camp shroud
						Associated with Knights of Lastwall
						Consumable
						Hides camps with illusions while travelling when tossed in a campfire
					Money!
						15+200+30
				Krug wants to deal with the bodies
					Funeral pyre
					Tetron reallocates to get produce flame
					Takes a couple hours
					Krug offers words of commendation and promises that, with this act, they won't fall to that which they were sworn to fight
		Back to the caravan
			We've basically consumed our entire day's worth of travel
			We have arrived at the exit to Giant's Teeth
Starday evening
	First watch - Alistair and Viola
		Alistair: We should hunt giants more!
		Alistair, through his spyglass, spots something
			Different birds live in these parts, rarer
				They sing in odd tones
		Also, plenty of caves around
			Alistair wants treasure
			They're all natural, though
	Second watch - Iris and Tetron
		Alistair tells Tetron about the weird birds
			Suggests that Taranis could investigate
			Viola tries her best to reproduce it, but it's not good
		Tetron asks Iris about the prosthetic
			Talking about the magic abilities
		Philosophical discussion about magic
			Logic vs perspective
			Tetron: "What are the limits if belief is all it takes?"
		Taranis returns
			Interesting body language...  Puzzled
			The birds speak of "the flower with purple petals"
				He doesn't understand
			Multitudes of birds of different species
				Different songs, but the purple flower one carried the most
				Something also about "seeing the path forward"
			Tetron notes that hawks are different enough from songbirds that something could just be lost in translation
			Tetron asks if Taranis feels any different
				Nope
		Iris asks why Taranis calls Tetron "Daddy"
			Tetron doesn't know
			Taranis says that it was when he was incarnated into this form and met his real father
				"Doesn't everyone call their father that?"
					Iris: No
						Her father fancies himself a great man, but he's just a pawn of his mother-in-law
						Tetron: Noble house?
							Not quite yet, more about naval power
						RETCON FLASHBACK - Iris had asked Khadija whether the Coalition is tracking House Kaulfield
							Only member of family still in Egorian is grandmother, but others are travelling elsewhere
								Parents both heading east
						Iris also sees her mother as a fraud, but to a lesser extent than father
				Iris acknowledges Tetron's family pride
					Not so close with father, but he didn't deserve his fate
						Died during the War for the Crown
				Chatting about other party members' family relations
	Third watch - Krug all by himself
		The first ray of dawn light brings with it a creature of fire
			Monavic deva
			It takes a large flaming sword and thrusts it into the ground
				Surprisingly quiet
			It speaks: "Krug Thorax, I bring tidings and a challenge.  A blessing to you from the Dawnmother, but first you must pick up this sword."
			Krug agrees and makes his way over to the sword
				He feels the sensation of call-to-action that he felt in the Lambent Meadow
					He feels the pang of doubt he felt at that time, but he pushes past it
			When Krug approaches the sword, he hears thousands of whispers expressing his own doubts
			Alistair and Iris wake up at this moment
				But they don't see the deva
				Alistair: Why is there a flaming sword?  It's too early for this!
					Krug: I don't know.
					Iris: Let him cook.
					Alistair: Is this a Sarenrae thing?
						Yes
						Okay cool
			Krug asks the deva what the meaning here is
				The journey toward finding yourself is long and doesn't end here, but your inability to fully embrace Sarenrae is a hindrance to you due to the deep self-loathing.
			The sword looks like it will hurt real bad
				He grabs it.  He roars in pain.
					Fire and mental damage
				But he does pick it up.
					He hears his own booming voice: "I am not that hero!"
				And then the sword vanishes and reappears in the deva's hand
				The deva offers a choice in power
					Retribution against those who harm friends
				"Well done."  It encourages his journey
			Tetron offers his staff of healing to Krug
			Iris saw all of this
				Krug is beginning the path toward becoming a capital-C Champion
				"And here I thought I was in the good graces of my god."
					"I just try to act as she sees fit."
				Genuinely impressed
			Krug looks down at his hands
				"I think I know why she made me do this."
				His handwraps are completely burned away
				He LoHs himself
				He leaves his hands unwrapped
Sunday morning
	Now that we're out of the ravine, it's a clear shot through gentle rolling hills
	Tetron spends the day working on scrolls in the wagon
		Sending in particular
		Iris suggests longstrider - but Tetron doesn't know it
		Viola wants thicket of knives - Also doesn't know
Sunday afternoon
	We start smelling nice scents
Sunday evening
	Smell has gotten stronger
	We can see wildflower fields in the distance
		They are not purple
	Iris asks Krug about this morning
		She admits to knowing what's going on
			"To put it simply, you're on the path to being chosen."
			Krug: She knew I wasn't ready yet
				Iris: What is preventing that?
					Need to be proud of myself
					Need to accept that I am redeemable
				Iris: It's difficult to make an impact on the word if you don't love yourself
	Iris volunteers to do solo watch
	First watch: Alistair and Tetron
		They hear a poof of a teleport
			Chimpy reports that Zaknos and Nilbog got to Zaknos's brother and are on their way back
				Tetron tells Chimpy to keep an eye on the other guy
				Chimpy: No news is good news
				Tetron asks whether Alistair can think of anything else to tell Chimpy
					Nope
				Tetron asks Chimpy whether he can take the doll for him and give it to someone who can make a good use of it
					Sure
					Chimpy: don't you think a doll this lovely should go to a child
						Tetron: it's magic, please take it to the university
			Tetron notices Alistair's expression
				Alistair wonders what the odds are that Zaknos ends up with it
		Alistair can still hear the birds
			Tetron considers the bird song about flowers
				No purple flowers along the way today
					Because none are native to the region
				No particular relgious meaning comes to mind...
	Second watch: Viola and Krug
		Viola earnestly expresses her conviction that Krug is the best of the party
			Not as a competition - quality of character
				Doing things for the right reasons
					Krug explains how back in the Hold, politics was violent
		Krug hears a thumping coming from the direction of the cargo wagon
			They approach
			Viola puts her ear up to the exterior
				Nothing
			Krug walks around the cart and doesn't see anything either
			Krug suggests that it might be worth it to knock
				Viola does
				No response
			Krug and Viola sit next to the cart for the rest of the watch
				Nothing
	Third watch: Iris solo
		Iris mulls the possibility of crossing paths with her family again
Moonday morning
	Alistair and Tetron are filled in about the thump
		Should we ask Margot for permission?
			She definitely doesn't know what's in it
			Never mind
	Iris makes a speak with animals scroll
Moonday afternoon
	We reach the highest density of flowers, and the bird are super loud
	Iris casts her speak with animals and goes to talk to them
		A robin comes down to here
			Iris asks what's with the purple flower
				It guided them to this place
					Birds from multiple directions
				It is good here
				Is this a new thing?  Iris doesn't see any purple flowers around
					Been doing it for past several seasons
					Some don't bother to migrate anymore
			The robin requests that we only take the existing desire paths
				Don't trample the flowers
			Other humans have been through
				Gone into a specific area in the fields
				They go in with some items and return with those same items
				They are gone now
			The robin asks whether Iris can make the conversation worth its while
				Iris offers a human femur
					It's thrilled
			Iris asks where the nearest purple flower is
				Directly below her
					Except there's nothing there but yellow flowers
						Her face paint is purple - the bird doesn't see it as purple
			Iris shouts out for Taranis
				What color are the flowers?  Yellow
	Iris returns to the group
		Viola suggests that maybe the birds see colors backwards
			Purple<->Yellow
	Alistair climbs a tree to look through his spyglass
		There's a cave area way down the path
		Tetron volunteers to stay behind to guard Margot
	Down the path
		Except we stop immediately
		Krug suggests that we have Taranis ask the birds more questions
			What color is Iris's face paint: grayish-yellow
			There was a rock that rolled away
				It was mossy
			Viola: What color are my hat and feather
				The feather is rainbow
				WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK?!
			Tetron considers what would permanently alter color perception
				Birds are tetrachromats
					Songbirds can see UV
			Timpani pokes her head out
				She points toward a particularly colorful and large bird and says that would know
				She can just feel it - it has magic
		Taranis approaches the bird
			It can help us, but Taranis cannot perform the task
				It needs one of us to take its form
				It can tell us what the deal is here
			Viola turns into a bluejay
	To the cave
		Light coming through the cave
		It's a forest down there, lots of tree roots
		Viola can see a way through
			A pine tree is spiraled and split open
			And a bit beyond: a misty forest beyond
				It's a portal!
					Timpani identifies it as Alsetan
					With gatestones and all
					Viola, as a bird, inherently knows the sign
			Timpani says that the others can just walk in
				Alistair approaches and begins to shrink and spiral into it
				Iris, Krug, and Viola enter
	We emerge in the Heartwood in the Isle of Arenway
		We're immediately welcomed by a guard
		Viola is inexorably drawn towards the scent of honey
		Alistair goes to look at the giant snails and then pools surrounding the central tree
			People soaking there
			A moth person welcomes Alistair
				Alistair explains that we're adventurers
					The moth points toward a shop called "Favors of the Wild" as potentially being of interest
				Alistair asks if this place is sacred to Alseta
					Nah, just the portal
					This place plays host to the Balance of Nature
				The moth notes that Alistair smells like he's swam in the astral plane
					Alistair doesn't know what it's talking about
					Almost like he was born there
		Iris catches the attention of a mushroom leshy as she is looking for Alistair
			"Looking for a child?"
			She offers assistance
				She speaks with a bird to send it out for help
					Viola can understand this
					The bird finds Alistair and reports back
						Iris goes to find him
		Krug asks which way the ambrosia is
			Viola points and has Timpani ask whether it's cool to take ambrosia
				The mushroom lady doesn't know, but the person who runs the place is kind
		Iris locates Alistair
			He explains that he found these magic pools that depend on moon cycles
				A different moth person approaches and offers a soak
					New moon approaching
					Could offer some boons
						But the moon is fickle
		Viola and Krug head toward Hall of Wild Ambrosia
			Pass plazas and other buildings
			It's taking all of Viola's effort to resist the ambrosia smell
			Woman inside the Hall
				With a chubby fruit leshy
				She's surprised to have visitors, as it's the off-season
			Krug explains the situation
				Might have just enough for a jar for one bird
			Viola loses her grip
				Streaks past the attendants
				She smashes her face into the last honeycomb of ambrosia
					This grants a +2 to all ability scores, but she's drunk now
				She's blissed the fuck out
			The attendant is crestfallen as she picks up Viola
				That was the last of it
				Iris and Alistair show up
				Krug takes her and offers compensation
					She is just a host, not a trader
				Krug suggests that he might ask around
					She's doubtful
						It goes bad quickly
				Winter is the season for this
				Iris suggests squeezing the ambrosia out of Viola
					Krug is against it
					But this was a waste of time otherwise
						She will go back and request that the songbird leave Viola a bird permanently
					Krug suggests that they could have Viola regurgitate it into the songbird's mouth mother-bird-style
						They bring Viola back through the portal
		Alistair wandered off
