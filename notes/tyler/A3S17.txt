-----

Fireday morning, shortly after dawn, at the Birch Branch
	Tetron found a package when we got back to the inn
	Varuk knocks at our door like half an hour after we got back
		Krug answers the door
		Varuk asks if this is a bad time
			Krug explains that we were out late
			Is it important?
		Njal Zarklis, the Aegis Coalition guy that the military captured, is ready for interrogation
			We have the slot for the whole day
			Tetron proposes that we sleep until 3 and go then
			This conflicts with Viola's matinee performance, so she needs to go get her understudy to take the shift
	After Varuk leaves, Alistair announces that he has something to go do
	Tetron to Krug: You think we can get away with using Charm in the gov't facility?
		No
		Also, he'd tell on Tetron
			Narc.
		Krug: It seems like a lot for a situation where we don't even know if they know anything
		Tetron prepares Charm anyway
Alistair heads to the orphanage
	He's looking for Mouse
	He arrives to find a large stack of building materials out front
		Might be because of his donation?
	He finds Mouse
		He reports that the party's going into the prison today
			Is there anything else to pass along to Dorfinn or Cloak?
		Mouse lets him into her room
			She doesn't look rested well
				Alistair notices, asks if it's about the torture she saw
					Before answering, she makes sure her bunkmate has already left for breakfast
					Stareye and others talking about gas canisters (large glass container) getting shipped into town
						All around the district now
					Greencloaks running extra security for the safehouses and the orphanage
					Alistair: Have the authorities been alerted?
						They recently seized some, but the rest is too recent, probably
			She remembers the initial topic
Meanwhile, Tetron inspects the package he received
	He also puts the flowers from the package in Goober's old jar
Back with Alistair and Mouse
	Notes for Dorfinn
		Fortifications set up
		Sal is under scrutiny
		Wynn is on leave
		State of Frey is solidified, as she's been seen multiple times in the company of Gavel Tarsus
	Alistair asks if there's any news on Mateo
		Nope
	He thanks Elwyn
		If she learns anything before 3, find Alistair
	Alistair leaves and heads back to nap
Back at the inn
	Tetron is in the common room, sitting near a fireplace that he had lit
	Alistair arrives and sees him reading
		Vase of blue flowers sitting next to him
		Alistair doesn't care and walks by
			Tetron waves and keeps reading and writing
	Tetron also writes a note to his mother
Viola jogs down to the Eight Cups Theatre
	She sees a bunch of production materials (sets, costumes, etc) being moved inside
	It's kind of a pain to make her way in
	Backstage and lighting are busy coordinating
	Viola finds the director, sprinting around
		The executing producer is following him around, micromanaging him
		Viola: I've had a schedule snafu, need to have Dana sub in
			That's fine, she's here, wait here
		Dana comes over
	On her way out, Viola nearly gets smacked in the face by a half-elven man
		He excuses himself before stammering something about her visage
			Viola: Yes?  Is something wrong with my face?
			Guy: Nothing, it's fine
			Viola: I insist, I'd love to know if something's up
			Guy: I'm not good at talking about this sort of thing...
				Waves over a dwarf with a violin and performer's clothes
					It's Reglin

Back at the inn, after sleeping ~2:45 pm
	We gather in the common room
	Tetron announces his package
		Does anyone know a Dietrich?
			No
		He hands the letter to Viola to read and pass around
			Viola: Cold snap in Augustana is odd
				Tetron: Yeah, and my family doesn't know a gardener by that name
		Tetron: However, I did take the advice to read it by the fire
			He holds it by the fire, and secret underlines are revealed, giving a coded message
				"Disturbance in Agrimony"
				"Olorin to address panic"
				"Infernal neighbors in west plan attack"
				"Shipment siez" (sic)
				"Dockward Hold capture Margaret"
				"Zaugia sending a friend to aid you"
				"Be safe"
				"I'm being watched"
				"Awidi"
			Shit...
				Alistair: Is this something we should tell the gov't?
					If Olorin already knows, gov't knows
				Viola: Since we know that Sloane is here in Almas and not in Augustana, we can't really assume she's involved
				Alistair: Since Sloane likes Andoran, we might want to talk to her about it
					She probably dislikes Cheliax too
					Viola: We can ask the prisoner about that
Varuk takes us to the Cerulean Keep
	Nilbog and Zaknos go get sandwiches instead
	Tetron to Varuk: Anything we need to know that has already been gotten out of him
		Captured about a month ago
		Paperwork on him that specifically noted that some sort of event happening on 19 Rova
		Found with hat of disguise
		Their name was in connection to multiple separate purchases from different jewel distributors
			Went unnoticed for a while
			But eventually the lack of info on the "buyers" caught attention
		Arrested on fraud and attempting to circumvent restrictions on quantity-restricted material (enchanted diamonds)
			Got caught in a sting
	Through security again
	Through a network of halls in the jail
		Two-guard escort
		Alistair keeps an eye out for people we know
			Female goblin named Jikai, that he's met in passing
				She and her father (Korjik) run the "less legal" side of trades
				She gives no indication that she recognizes him
	We arrive at a secure cell
		The sort that a non-caster would be interviewed in
		Dude inside is dark-haired, pale, tattoos wrapping around the face
		Guy: Oh, good another interrogation
			Tetron: How're they treating you
				Good, considering
				Would have been killed in home country
		Guy: You have questions to ask, I have unsatisfying answers to give
		Tetron: You know the name Sloane, yes?
			No reaction
			Tetron: You're less interesting than Sloane is or the thing she's planning
		Tetron: Where were you before you came to Almas?
			Around the city
			Tetron: Not in Augustana?
				Doesn't believe so
		Interrogation summary after I lost the thread
			Grilling him on Sloane
			Flexing our accomplishments
			Pressing on the bad things Coalition has done
				Murder, fraud, propping up the worst of the Lumber Consortium
				He says the price is worth it, and it isn't even that bad
					Viola: Tell that to Selma, Tessra, the Kellids of the Darkmoon Vale
				Viola: Ah!  An admission!
			Claims that he's doing the right thing
				Aroden's return would bring peace to his home country
					Cheliax
					Shit got super fucked when he died, and then House Thrune took over
			Viola: What do you know about...
				Sloane
				K Ego AS / S Ego AF
				Other people involved
				Day of the Inheritor thing
				Claims to not know
			Viola: We've got an actress, a life-long thief, and a champion of Sarenrae.  We can all tell you're lying.
		Tetron reveals the planned attack by Cheliax
			Dude didn't know
			We think Sloane might be responsible
			He genuinely believes that Sloane opposes 
			Is there anyone else we can talk to 
				Literature professor: Haufmain
					Also from Cheliax
					Ally in belief, not in action
				Tetron: how do you know Haufmain
					He doesn't.  Sloane speaks highly of him.
		Alistair: If we want to talk to Sloane after talking to Haufmain, where can we find her?
			Would be difficult to find right now
			Little far along timeline to locate her
			If we want to talk to her, do so on 20th
				Viola presses on potential timing
				Guy: Things are in motion, folly to interrupt now
		Tetron: What if the Chelaxian attack disrupted the thing tomorrow?
			He's willing to share, but we CAN'T tell the guards
				Dude demands that Krug promise
					Krug: Even info is important for saving lives
						Yes
						The guards would draw the worst possible conclusion
						Krug asks us if we think we can handle this ourselves
							Viola: We've been handling this by ourselves the whole time
					Krug agrees
		Krug exits the room to dismiss the guards from the observation room
			Tetron talks quiet to see if Krug can hear 
			Krug asks one of the guards can go get water
				Sure
		Krug comes back
			He couldn't hear
			Njal starts
				Have any of us heard of The Rending
					Some of us are vaguely familiar
					Droskar's Crag erupted in 3980, which flooded the Andoshen, burying entire sections of Almas
				Old temple to Aroden that was buried
					We've probably walked above it, as the modern Liberty District sits atop the site
					But the ruins are there deep underground
				And that's where Sloane is
					Tetron: How would we get there?
						Alistair: Prob sewers
						The gov't keeps a guarded entrance
						Coalition found other means of entrance
				Njal: It's buried for a reason
					It's quite an interesting experience; lots of history
					Not guaranteed that we'd live if we went
		Guard comes to let us out
			Njal insults the guard for being useless
				We got way more out of him in half an hour than they did in a month
			Alistair asks if we can talk to another prisoner: Dorfinn
				Alistair: He's not connected to Njal, but he has info that is relevant to our investigation
				Sure
	To another section of the Cerulean Keep
		Dorfinn and Carol are in different cells
			Dorfinn alone
			Carol has bunkmates, all teen together
		Area isn't secure enough to warrant an interrogation room
			Alistair asks for one anything
		Guard gathers Dorfinn and takes him down the hall
		Dorfinn is stunned to see Alistair and the rest of us
			As soon as doors close, he asks what Alistair is doing here
			He has something he needs to tell Alistair
				He didn't imagine that Alistair would be back in the city
				An item is being held by Wynn Lightfeather
			Alistair: Haven't found a way to get him and Cloak released, but we're working with the Greencloaks to get rid of the Clutch
				Does Dorfinn know anything else about the Clutch?
				He knows the boys behind it
					They weren't ever part of the Greencloaks, but he always had them in the periphery
					He took care of them for a short time
					They disagreed with him on how others in the city should be handled
				Warning: Take care when confronting them, they're dangerous and willing to do whatever it takes to take whatever parts of the city
				They are a fist-fighter
				Alistair: Frey joined them
					Could we get her to defect?
					There were disagreements
					Even if it's foolish, he still believes that there's good in her
					If Mateo is there, and he can be convinced, she may follow
			Alistair: Do you know Sloane
				Yes, they were friends and business acquaintences
				Alistair: She's in Almas and up to no good
					Does she have a hideout in town?
						Yes, it's a warehouse and living quarters compound (sounds similar to Bulwark and Bolt) underground
							Greencloaks and Sloane shared the space for some time
					Is there a way into that temple?
						He doesn't know anything about that.
				Alistair: What about the Aegis Coalition
					He knows the front
					Sloane's dedication 
					He believes that Sloane is a good person
					Alistair: Does he know any other Coalition members in town?
						Dalkan van Gandt
						Njal
			Alistair: Anything to tell the Greencloaks?
				Continue to keep the children safe
				Heard some whispers of unusual things going on in Timberfell
					If he knows the Fenners at all, they wouldn't hesitate to go after Tamuth House
						He does think that Frey would restrain him from that
			Alistair: Does party have any questions
				Viola: Don't want to embarrass Alistair by prying into personal lives
				Krug: What was he like young
					Got into trouble
					Quiet
					Good
			As he leaves, Dorfinn says "you don't have to use the whole thing, some of it can be discarded"
		Guard asks us to hang tight while she puts Dorfinn back
			The guard's name is Lindsay Canyonstrike (dwarf from Five Kings)
		Tetron chats with Lindsay on the way out
			He asks about some magic candle that allows communication with the dead that the military might use
			Lindsay says that they do for super-important stuff
			It's available for purchase, but only to Adept LAPs and above
	We're escorted to the front, and two folks are waiting for us
		Major Zinza (catfolk officer we've talked to before)
		Sirran Tahseen
			He visibly cringes at the sight of us
		Lindsay says that they requested to speak with us afterward
		Zinza speaks
			She summoned us because Tahseen has something to say
			He apologizes for misrepresenting his station and for not believing our results
				He's prodded to add that he understand that his behavior was unacceptable
				Bows excessively
				If there's anything that he can do to help, we can ask
					Alistair jumps right on: Individuals in Timberfell with gas canisters
						Zenza says that they're already on an investigation for it
						Alistair: Can we help?  We are interested in taking down the Clutch
							Zenza: For now, as we conduct investigation, please stand by to not compromise operatives
								Once that's done, she'll let us know what next steps we can take, if any
			Viola accepts the apology
			Tetron states that his faith in the institution of the military has been restored, just to twist the knife on Tahseen
			Tahseen asks to speak with Viola privately
	Over in a secluded area
		Tahseen drops his prideful demeanor
		He looked into Viola's files as part of his attempt to discredit us
			Viola's mom is in hospice care
			Viola puts her hand on Tahseen's shoulder and genuinely thanks him
				Tahseen uncomfortably points out that she's touching him
					She doesn't like it either
	What now?
		Multiple things in University
			Tetron wants to research Aroden
			Viola wants to talk to Savaxis
			We all should talk to Hoffman
University of Almas, mid-afternoon
	Viola goes to find Savaxis
		She has to ask around to find his office, since she doesn't know what he's a professor of
		Located, door closed
			Viola knocks
			"Not currently open for office hours"
			Viola, from Augustana
			He opens the door and recognizes her by appearance
		He lets her in
			Viola readies him for the Allison news
				And then tells him the whole thing
			Felix advises that adventurers on college campuses are being viewed with suspicion
				Why?
				Attack on Agrimony Point professor
					Krynt
						Viola knows of him due to gatestone
					Who attacked him?
						Not who, what: a red drake
							Viola puts the pieces together
								Tessra has plenty reason to want Krynt attacked
								Being intentionally vague
									Felix is all like, yeah, I don't want any part of that
				But that doesn't explain why adventurers
					Could be like an eidolon or something?
					Viola: Nah, it's Tessra's pet, but she's in prison
						But how'd it get in?  Airspace is secure
							He doesn't know
		Viola leaves to head for the Eight Cups Theatre
	Others go to library to research Aroden
		Alistair: Who still follows Aroden?
			Despite no powers, but a lot of people still revere him
				Especially due to feeling of things being better back them
				Also, transition from Aroden to Iomedae wasn't perfect
					Aroden was LN, Iomedae is LG
					Humanity-first, change, innovation, and such got left behind
					Cultural element of Arodenite philosophy was also pretty big
						And Iomedae is really freaking recent
							What gives her the right to swoop in?
					Common history likes to paint the transition as pretty smooth, but not quite the case
		Tetron: Shield of Aroden
			Component parts, abilities, impact of restoration
			He walks straight past all the common Aroden knowledge and goes to the librarian to ask for restricted access
				This shit isn't for normies
			He finds a bunch of documentation
			The Shield has been in several key conflicts and wielded by several people
				Aroden had it, of course
			The Shield was built by Aroden and its construction would be difficult to replicate by mortals
			It has broken and been reforged in the past
				So if Tetron finds the other piece, it would need to be reforged back in
				It would take a journey to find like a demi-god blacksmith to do that
			The Shield is also a symbol
				In the past, Arazni wielded it
					It hadn't lost a battle until her
					Her defeat was a huge blow to morale
						Especially when undeadified
				Pre-deity Iomedae used it for a time
					It broke after her ascention
			No idea how it would have ended up in some rando Galtan lady's possession
			Functionality: Protects the bearer from death (though there must be some limitation due to Arazni), buffs allies
		Alistair: What would happen to Iomedae if Aroden returned?
			The natural order of things would probably be greatly and irrevocably disrupted
				Not clear whether they'd split duties and shit
			No god has ever come back from the dead
		Tetron and Alistair reconvene and swap notes
			Tetron's findings need to be discussed in private
	Outside library
		They see a small group walking and talking, quickly
			Female elf who seems to be doing the briefing
				Black hair with graying
				Flowing robe with an eagle pattern spread across it
			People following her nod intently
			They go up a set of stairs
			At the last moment, Tetron catches a glimpse of someone who he recognizes
				It was a LONG time ago
				But the green in his hair has faded
				Tetron runs after them
	Up the stairs
		Multiple professors reach and all enter a room
			Dwarf
			Pink-haired old lady
			Green-haired guy
		As the door closes, Tetron catches it and opens it
			Elf at the front, the provost, demands Tetron identify himself
				This is a private meeting of faculty
				Tetron says that he's a friend of Mihail
			The green-haired gnome turns to face him and gives him a firm look
				Eyes don't make contact at first...  Looking near him, something he's holding
				Dude's able to control his emotions well
			Elf says that he can speak to one of the professors later
				Tetron excuses himself, saying that he must be mistaken
		Others find Tetron halfway up the stairs
			Tetron says that he knows the gnome from somewhere...
			Alistair asks if he should follow him home
				Nah, we should just talk to him
					Gotta talk to Haufmain anyway
				But what about Viola's play?
					She's going to perform other days
					Also, Day of the Inheritor is tomorrow
			Tetron: Someone could talk to Irontarn instead
				Krug volunteers to take Alistair
			Tetron waits for the meeting to end
Back to the Cerulean Keep
	They find Major Zenza talking to a dark-skinned guy
	Alistair: We're looking for Irontarn
		She pulls Alistair in close
		Zenza: How do you know this person?
			Tetron knows someone in Augustana who referred us
		Vabul Irontarn is in town, but pre-occupied
			Do we need to speak to her soon?
				Krug: Yes
				What business?  She's one of Zenza's more capable agents in Timberfell
					Alistair: Timberfell?  Is she looking into the gas canisters?
						Yes
				Alistair: Perhaps could discreetly meet instead?
					Zenza: She isn't expecting anyone, but perhaps a missive could be sent
						Zenza unpins one of her stars from her lapel
						Can speak with Zenza's authority
				Krug: How do we find Irontarn?  We haven't met her and don't know what she looks like.
					Zenza is surprised by this but recollects herself
					Long hair, color of drying wheat, one of very few dwarves there
Back with Tetron at the University
	After a long while, professors begin to file out
		Among the last to leave is the green-haired gnome, who is talking to the provost
			Talking about alchemical defenses for the university
			Provost: I'm sure it was just an isolated incident
			They notice Tetron
				Provost: Ah, you waited
					She excuses herself
	Mollick invites Tetron in
		Tetron says he's seen Mollick before and wanted to know where
			Tetron was a student at the university
				Mollick says that he'd only have met if he did alchemy
			As he speaks, Tetron remembers seeing him in one of his visions in the cold
				Tetron dead-ass admits that he's been having visions and Mollick's in them
				Mollick says that's a common side-effect of magic items
				Tetron asks about the Lake of Mists and Veils
					Recounts the events he saw
					Mollick doesn't 
				Mollick says that Tetron should go see a magic professor instead
				Tetron's done with Mollick being vague and calls him out
					Tetron: Do you just not want to talk about it?
						Yes
					Mollick relents and properly invites him in for tea
						Black
	Mollick admits to having known Tetron's great-great-grandfather: Targane
		Obstinately proud
		Close companion and ally for some time
			Begrudgingly called him friend, even though Targane wouldn't accept the term
		So, what does Tetron want?
			The visions... why were they so important
				Adventuring party, LoMaV, etc.
			Mollick warns that Tetron's life would be irrevocably changed (in a bad way)
				Tetron: This is my decision
				Mollick: I might as well be casting an 8th-level fireball at your head
			Just seeing Tetron's face makes Mollick relive those "terrible days"
			His companions are all dead now
				[NAMES TO BE GIVEN]
				Tiefling druid woman
				Brave halfling, trapfinder
					Didn't make it the whole way
				Massive orc, specialized in brutally destroying things and baking
			What they were doing
				Expedition of discovery
				LoMaV is an interesting geo feature
					It's been the setpiece for many battles in the past
					They wanted to learn more of its historical significance
						Originally not meant to be more than that
				When they arrived, cataloguing items and stuff beneath the ice
				However, they (just them and their guides) didn't know at the time that the world fell apart
					Aroden's death
					Visions perhaps related to that
					The lake changed
						Mollick's warning again
							Tetron insists that, since his companions are all gone, someone else needs to know
								Mollick says that it really should die with him
						It was a place of power
							Aroden defeated a mighty foe there once
						Amidst the chaos, Targane died, saving Mollick
							Tetron: When you say "passed away", what do you mean?
								Land upheaval, great flash of light, then his dead body torn asunder, his staff remaining standing
							Tetron makes a will save...
		Third-person view
			Tetron's grip on his staff tightens to the point where splinters start to poke into his hand
			A swell of arcane energy begins to emanate from Tetron
