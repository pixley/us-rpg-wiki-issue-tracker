Picking up on way to guard HQ
	Tetron and guard chat about the origins of Augustana
	Bounty:
		Capture of Remora: 10 gp
		Elimination of Remora's gang: 50 gp
	Called to meet with Barnes
		She's holding a small ribbon: it's a leg tie for Taranis
			Tetron also receives a map indicating no-fly zones
		We also get LAP ID cards - they're good for purchasing restricted magic items
		Party decides to put the bounty toward Tetron's fine
		Barnes has arranged for a local Kellid guide (female) to accompany us in our Tessra efforts
		We fill her in on the Joan and anonymous seller situation
			She asks us to pay Joan a visit, secure the item she was meant to give to Remora, potentially bring her in questioning
				According to Barnes: Joan is industrious, unlikely to give us trouble, but don't let our guard down
				50 gp reward on the line
				Joan is probably not working right now, but Barnes doesn't know where her house is
Heading out from guard HQ
	Most of party goes back to inn to heal up
		Not to full, but it's decent
	Alistair splits off (Taranis in tow) to scope out Joan's place in advance
		It's in the Fleet District
		Called the Coal and Iron
		Someone is working inside
			Male dwarf singing
		Building is nice and well-kept, polished to an impressive degree, even the roof and chimneys
		No second story (besides an outdoor storage loft), probably not Joan's residence
		Taranis flies to get a different angle and a closer look
		Dude is super deliberate about wiping up after himself immediately
			He takes a short break to make tea and supper
				Dude ate the tea leaves and mushrooms out of the tea
Party arrives as dwarf is locking up out back
	Taranis reports the guy leaving
	Viola starts toward the back
	Dwarf finishes locking up and starts to leave, Alistair follows from the rooftops
	Viola calls out to him
		Dude isn't happy about giving the address, but Viola convinces him using documentation from the guard
		Tetron helps out by talking himself up
		Address is in Oldtown
To Oldtown
	Buildings are largely old Taldan, not many homes
	Joan's home is rickety, four-story, all lit up
	Viola knocks and introduces herself
	Dude who answers the door shouts up the building then has to go upstairs to get her
	She asks us to be sent up
	We go up to the fourth floor through the rest of the sharehouse
Interview with Joan
	Joan claims:
		Has heard of Remora, was supposed to hand over an item to her at some point
		Was asked to do the handover
		Originally from Galt, her trip to Andoran was funded by way of transporting the brooch
			From church leader (Alseta)
		Was told by missive (anonymous) to give it to Remora
			The authenticity of the letter verified by an eye-based crest (Aroden?)
	Tetron asks why she left Galt
		Terrible place, unstable gov't, wealth or political savviness dangerous to have
		Was a luxury blacksmith, serving a local minor local noble
	Alistair goes inside to suss out the doorman (digging through personal documents)
		Inside a barrel of coals, he finds a token that says "the property of JK" on one side and has a chiseled leaf on the other; he doesn't take it
		Alistair looks for papers, none to be found
	Viola asks to see the brooch, Joan is resistant
		Viola suggests that Nilbog shows Joan the "egg"
		It is not like the "egg", but our story regarding it convinces her that we're trustworthy
			Esp. that we *also* don't trust the Andoran gov't regarding it
		She shows us the brooch, it looks like a face
			Multicolored gems forming the irises
			Gold trim, wooden construciton
			It looks foreign or antiquated
			Palm-sized
			Joan doesn't know the significance
				She was assured that, when the elder gave it to her, without a certain riddle, it's impossible to open
		Tetron casts detect magic, both the brooch and doorknob are magical
	Amlo is not the landlord; he just lives there
	Tetron appeals to Joan regarding handing over the brooch, noting that her safety is severely at risk
		She hands it over, and writes the riddle for us:
			Arrange mine eyes in circles true, and this aegis I give to you
			In the darkness full, my right by shade
			In sunshine bright, my left by hue
		Viola tells her to find us if she feels unsafe
	Back downstairs
		He doesn't go back in, as he hears someone walking around the ground floor (Amlo?)
		Amlo exits the building, seemingly trying to leave (he has an empty basket); Alistair tails
		Amlo heads into a crowded market and orders two skewers at a stand
			Nothing seems to have been passed alongside the payment
		Dude's making a sandwich the skewered meat
		Amlo enters a tavern
		Alistair activates his hat of disguise to turn into a non-descript street kid and enters
	Party heads back downstairs
		Amlo and Alistair are gone
		Party panic
		Viola runs back upstairs to ask Joan where Amlo tends to go
			Pig and Pit: biergarten-ish establishment
Meanwhile, at the Pig and Pit
	Amlo has gone to the outdoor section, Alistair follows inconspicuously
	Griv is out there, and Amlo heads toward him
		They're already acquainted
IT'S ANLO, NOT AMLO
	Griv sees us and starts to leave, but Alistair trips him
	Alistair then apologizes, offers to help him up, then grabs him tight
	INITIATIVE
		Viola menaces Anlo
		Nilbog tries to grab Anlo
		Two rogues approach the group and draw weapons
		Tetron casts charm on the one next to him (success) then moves to block Anlo
		Krug tries to grab the non-charmed one and succeeds, then asks her to drop her weapon, name-dropping the guard (this works)
		Alistair maintains his hold on Griv
		Anlo makes a break for it
		Viola runs after Anlo, gets in front of him, and grabs him
	We shackle Griv and Anlo and drag them into an alley to interrogate
		Griv's buyer is someone who works for Goss in Galt
		He offers his information bag as a show of goodwill (after trying to bribe Viola); Alistair pours it out; it's a bag of weasels
		Griv is released, completely ruined
		Anlo works for Zven's group "JK"
		Zven seems to be very interested in Joan's brooch
		Anlo hears through the doorknob, but he doesn't know how it works, just that he has to be in range
Tetron takes Anlo to the charmed employee and convinces her to give Anlo a job

Helja loot
