Resetting to just after speaking to Sabrina, but the rest of the party is there (Oathday, late afternoon)
	With the bulk of the party outside the interrogation room
		There is a small window in, but really only Viola's back is visible
		Dupont is complaining about the echoiness
		Viola emerges
			Dupont leaves us for a brief moment to secure Sabrina, and Viola gives a quick summary
	After Sabrina is returned to her cell, Viola asks for a moment to consult privately
		A bit of arguing and brainstorming
		The lack of Cheliff makes things difficult
			Can we go over her head?
				Tetron doesn't have a local connection of high enough station
		Lots of circular discussion, clarification
		Dupont checks in after a while
			Is everything okay?
			Iris suggests that it's time to rope him in
				He leads us to his office
	Dupont's office is incredibly tight, particularly for Krug
		He puts on some chamomile tea
		Viola requests that Sabrina's execution be stayed to help the Aegis Coalition
			Connection to Katius
		Why was Sabrina transferred to Taldor?  Who transferred her?
			Cooperation between then-deputy mayor of Alvis and Cpl Scipio of Eagle's Knot Garrison
				Viola: wuuuuuut?
		Can we stay the execution?
			Need authorization from Cheliff
			Iris: but what if Cheliff doesn't return?  We have no time
				Dupont: Could maybe tap Adm Kasaba...
					If Cheliff doesn't return in an hour
Outside Greyguard
	Viola: We need to split up
		Tetron heads to the IMG to get affidavit
		Viola heads to Hosetter to ask Buracir about prisoner exchange
		Krug heads to Alice's hotel to ask about Sabrina's standing with the Coalition
		Alistair goes to find Khadija to ask about Sabrina's standing with the Coalition
		Iris heads to the C&T Warehouse to ask about Bellflowers' knowledge of Sabrina
Iris at Warehouse
	Iris is given a note from Khadija with her new location
	Iris asks about Sabrina
		She's given a file on 15-ish trafficking operations
			Worked with the late mayor in Alvis
				New mayor has cut off direct aid to Bellflower
				(Note: Abigale is responsible for the old mayor's death, per Iris prior knowledge)
			Did other ops in and around Augustana
		Info on the new mayor?
			YES
			Originally picked as deputy mayor as a local gov't unity thing
			Name: Tuwile Elescorri
				Originally a prominent family in Zavar, Taldor
				That branch left Taldor prior to the War for the Crown
					Larger family neutral in the war
			Lack of connection to Cheliax doesn't necessarily mean that she wouldn't benefit from their intervention
Iris to Khadija's new place
	It's a hostel in New Codwin
		Shared space with several others
	Khadija says she needed to speak with us
		Can Iris assemble the party?
			No time
		DANGER
			Last thing Khadija remembers
				She was working in her office and felt a very powerful force that she believes is necromantic wash over her
				She used an item she happened to have nearby to prevent a full possession
				And she stabbed herself
			She was fighting against a vengeful spirit
				It was trying to direct her towards some individuals
					Middle-aged blonde woman and brownish-red-haired man
					They live in a shack or some kind of shared building
				Iris tells her that it was Tessra Briarwood
					Khadija: This person must HATE Viola
			She didn't come to until after being brought back to the city
				She never saw Coimbitore
	Iris: Know anything about Sabrina Pierce?
		Worked with Coalition for a bit, but she was apparently suspected of betraying them
		As far as she knew, Sabrina was in an Andoren prison
		Iris clarifies
		All Khadija knows about Scipio is that he was killed by the Radiant Dawn
	Khadija hands over an address from the possession
		It's in Almas, apparently in Castoff Place
Alistair heads out to Kodarod
	He hears conversation as he approaches
		Deep, booming, upset voice
			Something is atrocious and cannot be allowed to stand
		Someone else: has to wait until the other speaker returns
		Deep voice: Who else is still loyal?
		Other: House of Rest?  House Dechamp?
		Deep voice: House of Rest is a no-go, and they haven't worked with Dechamp for too long
	At this point, he enters the main cavern
		New person here: half-elf male, dressed in servant's clothes
			As soon as he sees Alistair, he bows and leaves
		Alistair asks about Khadija
			She's already been escorted away
				Awoken back near the city, away from the caverns
		Alistair shoots his shot: anything about Sabrina Pierce?
			Heard some info, but not exactly recent
			Imprisoned pending execution
			Did some work in Oppara back when Coimbitore was there
				Ousted by a "striped individual"
			Worked with the Coalition, specifically trading info to help free slaves
				Soured relation, but Coimbitore believes it was a setup
					Coimbitore doesn't know more personally, but he has a contact: Gaultier the Galbrate
						Easy to spot, as he is a completely beardless dwarf
						But he's paranoid and slippery
						He's rarely in his office
						He generally finds Coimbitore
		So, what info does Coimbitore want in return?
			Since Alistair doesn't know anything about Taldor...
			Alistair suggests stuff about Almas
				Omerta?
				Alistair shares everything he knows about them
	Alistair heads to the Roaring Hall in search of Gaultier
Krug at the muscle maid inn to talk to Alice
	Alice is woken up from a nap
	Krug asks to speak privately
		They head upstairs to her room
			Fleche is fast asleep
	Krug asks about Sabrina
		She met Sabrina on a few occassions
		Gave info about Andoren gov't movements
		She was serving as a go-between for the Coalition and the Bellflowers
			Working with Bellflowers directly was difficult due to ideological differences
		Amos came to believe that there was some dishonest dealing, and he coordinated planting of evidence to get her out of the way
			And then tipped off authorities to indicate a Cheliax connection
		What about the Taldor thing?
			Unknown
		Who worked with her?
			Someone up north at a fort or some other military installation
			Amos even made the trip out for it
		Alice expresses regret for her and Amos hurting Sabrina (and likely others) in this way
			She has some paperwork that would help, but it appears to be blank
			It would implicate Amos
			And it's written with his blood
	One more thing
		Alice says that they weren't privy to much of what was going on while they were captive, but Fleche heard some kind of worship service one night near Amos
			Singing and the like
				Topics: redemption, fate, service
				There's a whole song pamphlet of Coalition hymns
			When was this?
				Sortly before we arrived
	Alice suggests that we all talk sometime later
		We gotta keep Fleche from being scared of Iris
Viola at Hosetter
	She asks for Buracir
	Buracir agrees that the whole prisoner transfer situation is super sus
	Buracir is elated that Admiral Kasaba is going to get involved
		She considers her to be the one "normal" person in the city's apparatus
Reconvene at Greyguard
	Tetron presents the official documentation
	Krug mentions the documents and that Sabrina was framed
	Alistair piggybacks off of Krug's thing to mention what he learned from Coimbitore, but he didn't find Khadija
	Iris did find Khadija and explains Scipio's connection, and reports her account of shade-Tessra
		Also, Bellflowers reported the deputy-mayor's connection with Abigale
		Tetron explains that Alvis was of interest back when Taldor-Andoran relations were worse
		Also the Elescorri family
			Tetron jumps on: they dealt in rare metals
			Viola: Is there a connection between Elescorri and Karthis?
				Yes.
	Krug: Fleche is scared of Iris
	Viola reports that Kasaba is good to work with
	Tetron reallocates for Ghost of Dead Works
	Meanwhile, Iris hands over the address note to Viola
		It's her dad's apartment
			But how though?
				Iris says that a common Arazni blessing is info against the target of vengeance
			Iris suggests getting Zaknos and Nilbog involved
				We summon Chimpy and give him the rundown
	Spell cast!
		Various dealings and info about Amos, Sabrina, and various other agents
			Bellflowers from various locations
				Including Egorian (which is now defunct)
			Most recent entries detail Sabrina mentioning something being delivered to Agrimony Point (that something certainly being the gatestone)
Back to Dupont
	He acknowledges that Cheliff is still absent
		So we go with the contigency: going across the street to the Admiralty Citadel
	All six of us are led to Kasaba's office
		Short hair, stocky
		Greets us with a smile
		She's surprised to see Dupont
		He explains the situation
		Viola gives her case for the stay of execution
		Kasaba admits that Cheliff will be kind of pissed about this
		Iris also brings up the conflict of interest regarding Cheliff
			Kasaba mentions that Elescorri has connections with the Orthodox faction
		Viola explains that we need the duration of the trip, plus a few days
			Kasaba grants a five-day delay, which means that the new date is a week from today
To the launch of the Flinthawk
	We walk with Kasaba, since she's seeing the expedition off anyway
	We come upon a graying man who seems unhappy to see her
		He's the captain (Reid Grantham)
		Also a dwarven woman and a half-elf enby
			The dwarf, Jessie, is the pilot
			The half-elf is Dominic Eiredor
		There's also a swampy looking woman (leshy)
			Her name is Bhoja
	Kasaba advises us on the captain giving us a hard time
	The ship has oversized masts and sails
	The ship smells of animals and hay
		Something's pawing below deck
	Grantham addresses us
		Introduces himself and the others
			Eiredor says that they'd like to brief us when we have time
		Grantham says that he'll brief us tomorrow
		He then leads us below deck
			All that's down here are ballistae and a holding pen for a pegasus and a giant eagle (Sixir and Shinbira, respectively)
				They'll aid in the pursuit
				Two of us will be getting a crash course on flying them
				Tetron introduces himself to them and instructs the rest of us to do the same
			Grantham says that, should we not have two among us suited for flight, Eiredor can step in, but he would prefer otherwise
	Assignments
		Tetron on Sixir, Alistair on Shinbira
			The consideration is that having the ranged folks on these is ideal
			Tetron already has proper riding training, but Alistair has nothing of the sort
			TRAINING MONTAGE
				Dominic helps Alistair
		The rest of us will defend the ship
			And also operate the ballista
			Though Shinbira could carry one of us to drop onto a dragon
			Bhoja chats with this group
				The Dragonfen is home to many varieties of small drakes, plus various other creatures (both magical and non-magical)
				We will not be landing in the swamp, so we don't need to worry about non-flying creatures
				Which dragons we'd encounter is limited by which kinds would ally with the Bains
				Most likely drakes
					Horned and predator drakes
					Krug knows about horned drakes
						They're melee combatants
						They do have a breath weapon, but it's short-range
						One would dive-bomb
						Large size
						Venom (has a stinger)
						Fast, both on land and in the air
					Bhoja gives the rundown on predator drakes
						More cat-like in its behavior (hit-and-run)
						Also venomous
						Likes to pick up prey and then drop it
					Neither would easily board the ship while it's at speed, but they need to be dispatched quickly should they make it
					Bhoja has antivenoms
				And the Bains
					Baron Bain is poisonous
					Baroness Bain is not a natural-born dragon, but she uses fire
						Holy damage good against her, as she is a Lamshtan fleshwarp
				As for the ship's flight, height is valuable for preventing detection, but the ship is less maneuverable up high, and there's less air up there
					Hoping for cloud cover
	Viola asks Bhoja about the area around where the hoard will be
		Bhoja explains that it's near Dunholme
			Which was a town that fell prey to some doom
			Some sort of creature emerged from a well
				Pure evil, taking the form of the first person it killed (allegedly)
			This is near where Baroness Bain was first sighted
		Very dense forest
		Bhoja warns against fighting inside the hoard location
			Very well defended
	Alistair getting the hang of flight
		Starting to be able to let go with hands
