Tessra asks how she is supposed to meet with folks in Augustana
	She is wanted
	Plan to disguise
What was Tessra even doing here?
	She's trying to find the second gatestone to open the Skyward Oak
		She claims it's a convenient location to come back to
			Kind of sus
			She apparently has friendly folks in the area and has cause to come back
				Viola warns her that the Andoren gov't won't like that
		Tessra's forces arrived to find a platoon of Deadknuckle's men at or near the Skyward Oak
			They killed them
			The drake got sent this morning to go after any potential stragglers
Back to the camp
	Return Mr. Bilger back to his family
		His wife insists on giving us some reward
			Viola declines, saying that we're there to help
			Zaknos asks for a sandwich
	With the overseer gone, the Bilgers have nothing left
		Tetron suggest taking them back with us
			He's a wizard and can summon magic horses
			Viola says they could just take a wagon from the camp
	Alistair looks through the overseer's house again
		Only finds a wooden dildo
	We've assembled a convoy of 15 people
		Bilgers (5), Tessra, Cedrog, Kiruka, Party (6), Marcellus
Travel!
	Evening arrives as we get into the farmlands outside Augustana
	Marcellus speaks to Krug
		He asks who Krug worships
			Sarenrae
			"Who exactly does she redeem?" - Anyone who is regretful and willing to face the concequences
			"Maybe, one day, you'll come to accept that what you've done wasn't as necessary as you think it to be."
	Krug calls a team meeting
		Concerned about Tessra's lack of remorse about all the murder
		He and Viola went into this whole thing thinking that maybe that Tessra was misunderstood
	Tetron and Zaknos first watch
		Tetron bails as soon as folks are asleep
		Zaknos is sitting there distracted about having had a sandwich that day
			He sees nothing
	Viola and Alistair second watch
		Viola does a head count, all there
		Alistair notices that Cedrog has tried to open his manacles and is pretending to be asleep
			Alistair approaches and looks for whatever he was trying to pick with
				His toothpick is next to his hand
					Alistair goes for it and takes it
		No incident
	Meanwhile, Tetron gets to Augustana
		He hails the guard and asks for Barnes
			It's a matter of urgency
			Dude checks Tetron's LAP ID
		It takes 20 minutes for Barnes to be brought out
			Tetron starts to speak, but she takes him inside the gatehouse for privacy
			He explains that we have Tessra, Cedrog, and Marcellus
			He hashes out details of a negotiation-turned-capture with her
				Arriving in late morning
				Barnes has a place she wants in the hills
					Should be safe
					No settlements
					Will need to convince Tessra to be chill with it
					We arrive at the gate, they "tell" us where to go
					She'll send folks in advance, including anti-magic specialists
				If this works, she will forgive the remainder of Tetron's fine
			Tetron needs to return
	Krug and Nilbog third watch
		Krug mentions the Marcellus conversation to Nilbog
			Advises Nilbog to talk to him
		They hear off to the left Cedrog try to search for something
			Krug goes over
				"You can't reach your face"
				Nilbog sticks some grass in his mouth
					"Thanks..."
				"What're you gonna do once you turn me in?"
					Move on, probably
					Cedrog makes fun of our lifestyle
				Krug gives a small word of turn-around opportunity
		Tetron arrives, tidies himself, and goes to sleep
			Cedrog notices
				"Aren't I entitled to a bathroom break?"
				He apparently noticed that Tetron had left earlier
Morning
	Nilbog goes to see if Deadknuckle needed to change his grass
		He spat it out immediately
	Tessra wishes us good morning as she prepares
		Viola puts make up on Tessra to set up the disguise
	We prepare to leave
		The kid asks if he could perhaps learn to do magic when he's older
			Tetron gives token advice
Arrival at Augustana
	Viola explains the party's business and asks for a meeting with Barnes, Olorin, and Shanks
		We're allowed in
	Streets crowded, some kind of festival impending
	Viola realizes that they should take care of the Bilgers before moving on, she suggests the Jaw and Mead
Viola takes Deadknuckle to talk to the Big Three
	[need to fill in]
Back at the Jaw and Mead
	Do we bring Kiruka?
		Not necessary, but probably should, since she was there
	Tessra talks to Tetron
		She hasn't been in a settlement larger than a town in a long time
		She misses part of it
		Villagers were friendly to her and her family
		Tetron talks about being a city boy
			Trying to cover for his tiredness
				She seems to buy it
			Alistair chimes in
		She asks where Tetron's from - Oppara
			She doesn't know much about Taldor
			He says that Andoran and Taldor are pretty similar
				Hasn't been to Galt or anything
		Where does she want to travel?
			Visiting her brother's settlement
				In a far forest
			Plans to visit her father
				Apparently an elemental
				Will apparently see him soon
				Lives on the coast
	Viola returns
		Viola reports about the meeting
			Tessra is curious as to why we don't have it here
				For her and the city's safety
		We should get lunch
			Tessra would like a sandwich
			SHAWARMA!!!
To the meeting
	We arrive, and then Barnes and Shanks arrive
		Shanks's wheelchair is fast
	Fake negotiations begin
		Gov't acknowledge her help with Deadknuckle
		Gov't wants to negotiate peace
		Meanwhile, troops are circling around
			Conventional and magical
		Gov't acknowledges the gates opening
			Don't want to trample on the rights of those who have accessed, but they want some kind of security
			Tessra wants non-regulated access, with the exception of a "few actors"
	Slight motion of the hand from a commanding type in a tree
		Troops appear and surround Tessra
		We try to talk her down
			"I wanted you to be the good guy"
COMBAT
	Round 1

		Viola steps up, fails to feint, then gets off a bon mot

		Nilbog takes out holy water, approaches Tessra, and tries to shove his bottle of holy water in her mouth but fails
