-----

We appear in the Aroden temple
	We enter one-by-one
		The sensation of the transition is as though our bodies are malleable
	We find ourselves in a large rectangular room
		Six supporting pillars, but one has collapsed
			Cave in on that side of the room
		Strong cave-like dampness
			Obvious evidence of flood damage
		A large door on the opposite side of the room protrudes from the wall
		Our footsteps in the puddles echo
		Broken bookshelves
			Contents likely unrecoverable
		Broken fountain on one wall
		Unrecognizeable tapestries
		Definitely the foyer
			The size of the room indicates that the overall temple is huge
	Nilbog looks upward towards one of the corners
		He catches sight of a winged limb that retracts right after
			Based on the size of the part he saw, the creature is likely huge
	Viola looks for evidence as to whether anyone else has been through here
		Dust, rust flakes, etc seems to indicate that this room hasn't been occupied in forever
	Tetron analyzes the architecture
		The materials are local, but the build style is consistent with Taldan 
	Tetron and Krug start to head toward the door
		As they move, a large shadow moves, and they can see two glowing dots (eyes)
			The dots appear to be Krug-shoulder-width apart
			Tetron messages the others to quietly communicate to stop and be quiet
				Nilbog responds that he had seen it first, but thought that its retreat meant that it was afraid of us
		Tetron tries to identify it (winged, subterranean, huge)
			He had heard of sphynxes from Cyrus
			Large headdresses
			Traditionally found in deserts, though
				However, Cyrus had mentioned variants
					Subterranean variants are bat-like
			They are generally open to parley, though not more than once or twice
				Enjoy knowledge, banter
			Territorial
			Many sphinxes may have agreements with mortals
				Seems likely given that there's no food in the room
		Tetron messages Alistair: we will likely have to engage with it; try to sneak around the perimeter and get to the door
			Alistair acknowledges and takes position behind one of the pillars
		Tetron signals to the others that he's about to speak
			Viola and Zaknos move to join him
	The bat-like sphinx comes down from hanging upside down from the ceiling
		It and Tetron greet each other
		Tetron asks if this is its realm
			No, just here temporarily with some others for a mutually beneficial
		It introduces itself as Grisha
		Tetron claims that we're here to meet a friend
			Grisha says that "friend" and "enemy" are "mortal terms"
			It says it should probably alert the others, but it's bored
				It asks if we'd like to satiate its hunger: knowledge or flesh
		Tetron says that he's happy to share knowledge
			He introduces Viola as our resident storyteller
		Viola tells it about the Alsetan temple in the Arthfell Forest
			It likes that, says two more and it won't even participate in coming battles
		Tetron suggests that it could learn about the recent events in Falcon's Hollow
			It says that its circle knows some about it
			Tetron asks if it'd like to hear a first-hand account
			Viola tells the story
			It likes that
				It approaches closer in great interest
					We can see its gnarly claws, leathery wings, and twitchy ears
		Krug says that he has a riddle
			"What gets wetter the more it dries?"
			It ponders this while chirping happily
			It doesn't know
			"A towel!"
			It laughs
				"I never tire of riddles from mortals"
		It suddenly drops to the floor
			It moves over to the door, takes a large rock off the floor, and breaks the lock on the door in one blow
			It says that it hopes to see us soon before jumping back up to the ceiling
		Alistair drops his stealthy stance and starts working on the lock
		Tetron high-fives Krug and Viola for their work
		After a moment, something occurs to Tetron
			That lock hasn't been touched in hundreds of years
			That means the room was sealed
			Sphinxes can't teleport
		We chill while Alistair works just to make sure Grisha is in plenty of a good mood when we leave
The next room is an even more massive chamber
	Double doors at each cardinal direction
	Huge chandelier broken, having fallen onto one of the four large pedestals
	Humanoid skeletons
	Large cave in, with rocks fallen upon a huge spiky humanoid automaton
	A collapsed wall on one side of the room where something has burrowed into and out of the temple walls
	Tetron detects magic
		Central dais seems to be some kind of magic button that would require lots of weight
		Automaton barely has a magical signature left
			He finds an Arodenite insignia on its chest
	Once the door is closed behind us, Tetron reports his thoughts on the lock
		Viola: Makes sense, since we already guessed that with Sloane in town
	Alistair starts snooping around
	Krug goes to inspect the automaton
		Its intricately carved with Arodenite imagery
		Its face is almost lion-like
		As he gets close, he hears a mechanical whirring noise
			But the automaton doesn't seem to be aware
		In its arms are a dozen or so humanoid remains
			Priestly garb adorns them
			He supposes that it was trying to protect them
		Some bodies that he passes reminds him of the identifying stuff from that water creature we fought in the sewers under Timberfell
			He tells the rest of us
				Viola initially thinks that this solves that mystery, but then she thinks of it more and doesn't know why the Coalition would send something to mess with Timberfell
	Alistair asks Tetron if he's good to explore the burrow tunnels
		Tetron advises that we go together
			And he's not even sure where we're going
				He consults Nilbog
				Nilbog identifies this as some kind of service space for common folk
					However, its less of a central pulpit and more of a conference space
					But it's missing some stuff: crypts, holy fountains, and sacrifical chamber
				Tetron's follow-up question
					So what are we looking for?
					If we were doing some kind of prayer ritual thing, where would we do that?
						Krug: Inner chamber
	Nilbog loses interest and starts to follow Alistair
		Tetron relents, supposing that if whatever dug the tunnel (a worm or something?) belongs to Sloane, the tunnel might lead us there
			Viola asks Zaknos how old he thinks the tunnel is
				Zaknos's conclusion: This was dug at least 100 years ago by something big
We proceed into the tunnel
	Alistair immediately heads south, roughly back the direction we came
		He finds a large statue depicting a praying humanoid
			It's draped in seaweed
		There's a hall connecting back to the entrance
		There's offering money
		Alistair mentions that it has a weird hat
	Tetron reminds Alistair to not take any coin
		He knows not to take from religion
	Tetron detects magic
		The statue is necromantic
	Viola inspects the "weird hat"
		Turns out the statue depicts Aroden
		And its holding treasure and baubles
			Tetron asks Alistair to check whether anything there is modern
				They're all water-damaged
	We turn around and head down the north tunnel
		We find a small room
			Inside is a sarcophagus and a ruined fountain
				The sarcophagus has an active abjuration magical effect on it
			Tetron: maybe we should check inside
				Alistair: Hell yeah
				Viola: NO!
			Tetron analyzes things further
				This was apparently important enough that the magic is still plenty strong, as strong as we are
			We argue a bit, but we decide to leave it for later
			Tetron inspects the fountain: necromancy and transmutation
				Viola: How often does the decanter work?
					Tetron: As often as we want
					Viola: We should fill the fountain, then
				Nilbog pours holy water into the basin
					The fountain burbles again as water fills its system
					The sarcophagus remains unchanged
				We leave the fountain alone as it flows
			Viola suggests that we go up the stairs
				Except the door is closed and doesn't appear to have any handle or anything
				Nilbog lightly knocks on it
					No immediate response
					We do hear slight scuttling sounds from the other side
				Tetron determines that the door is mundane
					He looks for hinges
					Turns out the door is a lifty door
						And Krug can't lift it
					And it turns out all the doors are of this make
						The one we came though was busted
Return to the automaton room
	On the way, we note some sphynx footprints along the way
	Two of the four sets of candles in the center of the room are now lit
		Tetron: Maybe we should find another fountain
	Tetron looks at the chandelier
		It's a big boy
		It's broken
		Its magic (just creates magical light)
	Viola considers the candles
		The fire is magical
		Nilbog picks up one of the lit candles
			It goes out until he puts it back
			He then picks up one of the unlit candles and tries to light it
				No dice
	Alistair starts to head toward the foyer
		Wait!  Stop!  The sphynx!
		Actually, we saw the footprints, so it left
			So where did it go?
			We look and it seems like it came into this room, and then crawled up the ceiling into one of the holes left by the cave-in
	Maybe the offering statue lights the other candles?
		We have no gems
		Tetron: Perhaps Aroden likes other stuff?  Religion boys?
			Krug considers this
				Could give things relevant to Aroden's tenets?
				But the benefit given by the statue would only be for the giver, rather than solve the candle situation
			Viola: Good that it doesn't stop us, since the only one of his concerns that we have is humans, and we shouldn't sacrifice anybody
				Tetron: But one of them is "fulfillment of destiny", and what destiny is better than the destiny of lovers, so why not the dubious love potion?
	Alistair calls out from the foyer
		There are a few magical books over there
		Tetron heads over
			They have a transmutation aura
			The books aren't actual books, but a wooden carving made to look like four books
			He pulls the books out, revealing a tunnel that was once just a safe in the wall
				This means that someone must have come back after the fact and disguised the tunnel afterward
Into the bookcase tunnel
	It's dark, and Tetron casts dancing lights
	We hear a slurping down the way
	Krug leads on after the slurping noise
	We reach a small nook
		Looks like some human remains that had been devoured long ago
		Alistair takes a look and sees nothing out of the ordinary
			Krug next to him
	Something drops onto Krug
		It seeps into the space between Krug's armor and his clothes
		It smells sulfurous
		It seems to be corroding the armor
		He tries to smoosh it into his gauntlet
			He grabs hold, yanks it out, and yeets it at the others' feet
		The slime makes for Zaknos
			Tetron casts chill touch - crit
			Viola stomps on it
			Nilbog geysers it twice with the decanter - pushing it away 10 feet
		Nilbog continues to keep it at bay until it dissolves away
		Fortunately, Krug's armor only took surface-level damage
	We look inside the nook
		Multiple creatures had been dragged in
			One is holding some kind of talisman
				Tetron analyzes it: it's a small wooden coin affixed to a string
					Diplomacy bonus
End of the tunnel
	We find another room with a sarcophagus and fountain
		Except this one is more damaged
		The sarcophagus is ajar from the rocks falling on it
			Tetron takes a look inside: a dead body and treasure
				Holding a sceptre
			We leave it alone
				Except Tetron flicks a piece of chalk into the gap
	Tetron and Nilbog fill the fountain
		We have no indication on our end that anything happened
			The doors didn't open
Back in the main chamber
	All candles are lit
	The dais is now active
		Tetron considers it
			Its inscribed with arcane runes related to the candles
			However, there are two indentations in its surface that are like huge footprints in its surface
			Tetron: We could move some of the boulders
			Viola: Maybe all six of us could stand on it?
				Krug, weighing upwards of 400 lbs with armor, gets it to compress some
					Probably need a half-ton
			Tetron sees the chandelier above and asks about dropping it
				Viola: There's the broken one already
	We move rocks and broken chandelier
		It's not enough
		Also, the doors move somewhat, but it seems to be tied to the weight on the button already, so we can't use our weight and also leave the room
	Grisha appears again and offers its help, for a favor
		Tetron points out that, if it has to stay here, we wouldn't be able to leave unless it let us
			And it probably has better things to do
		We decline
	Krug insists that we see about the automaton, since it's trying to move
		Viola: It's not like we'd be able to help, given that it isn't moving the rocks at all
		Tetron: But maybe we could fix it
		Tetron takes a look
			Could jump-start it with a spell
		Krug analyzes it as though it had some amount of anatomy
			But it's not particularly helpful
		Tetron hits it with a 4th-level lightning bolt
			It activates some, looking around somewhat
			We need more, but what about Sloane?
				Tetron decides that the rest of us can do enough damage and pumps another lightning bolt
	The automaton activates
		Its attention immediately turns to Grisha
		Its one good arm pushes up, while the other detaches
		It stands at full height, towering over us
		It draws a massive longsword and points it at Grisha
			Something emits from the sword and Grisha nopes out of that
		With Grisha gone, it sheathes the sword, then stands and looks at us intently
		Tetron: Thumbs up or thumbs down if you understand us
			It gives a thumbs up
		It points to the four doors and gives an inquisitive look
			Tetron starts to explain that, yes, we do want the doors open, and we'd like to come back
			Viola interrupts to suggest that it's asking which door we want
				Oh!  Of course!
		Which door do we want?
			Viola suggests north, since that's the most obvious way forward
			Tetron wants to see what's up the stairs to the east and west
				We agree on the doors
		Tetron asks the automaton whether it can detect others in the building
			It takes a moment, then nods
			Which way?
				It points north
				Straight shot?
					Yes
		Tetron says that the automaton may need to help us
			The other people are doing bad stuff
			Also, 
Up the western stairs
	At the top of the stairs is a statue of an equine creature with a large horn
		It has an inscription: "the innocent may proceed"
	There's a burrowed tunnel to the west, but the statue is still in the way
	What does it mean by "innocent"?
		Viola: Perhaps it cares about Aroden's anathema?
			Which would be: Doing things that make humanity less prosperous, regressive policy, destroying cultural touchstones, destroying historical knowledge, ignoring the call of destiny
			Tetron: Not feeling too great about this...
	We can hear faint chanting...
	Who is the most innocent?
		Are non-humans kosher?
			Maybe Viola?
		Maybe child-like innocence?
			Viola: Alistair isn't innocent
		Tetron: Krug is the best of us
			Viola: Yeah, let's send Krug
	Krug goes up
		He's greeted by the spiritual image of a unicorn
		It bows, the statue moves out of the way, and the unicorn disappears
		All good?
		Nilbog goes up next and passes
	From the main room, we hear Grisha make an echolocaty sound, followed by a crash
		We go to the door
		We can see Grisha trying to bat the chandelier down onto the automaton's head
		Tetron tells the automaton to get out of the way and take down the chandelier itself
			It moves, and all the doors shut
				Which means that Krug and Nilbog are trapped upstairs
		Tetron asks Alistair to go scout
Alistair reports
	Grisha and the automaton are in active battle
	Grisha is hanging on the chandelier
	The automaton's sword has too much inertia to hit the agile Grisha
	The automaton looks likely to lose eventually
Back in the side room
	We should go
	Viola tells Krug and Nilbog through the door to hang tight while we help the automaton
		Tetron: No, they should forge ahead
		Viola: Forging ahead would probably kill them
		Fine, they should hang tight
	Viola, Tetron, and Zaknos go to meet up with Alistair
In the stairwell
	Krug and Nilbog decide to check out the burrowed tunnel
	The tunnels are smaller
		Either a smaller creature than or a younger version of whatever dug the other tunnels
	The chanting grows louder as they proceed northward
	As they continue forward, they can make out the specific sounds of the chanting (it's not in a language they know, though)
	They creep around a corner and find themselves at a walkway around the second floor overlooking the open-air chamber below
		Base of some large sacrificial altar
			Torches, candleabras, braziers
			Several people, including someone in the center, leading the chanting
				Pale woman with black hair, wearing crimson robes
				Some other people patrolling around rather than actively participating in the ritual
		Krug and Nilbog don't seem to be noticed, aided by the sound of the chanting, but they definitely can't get closer without being seen
Back in the pedestal chamber
	The automaton seems to have scored a solid hit on one of Grisha's wings, but Grisha is still at it
	Tetron shouts out: forget the chandelier, worry about the bat!
	INITIATIVE!
Krug and Nilbog overhearing during the fight
	Someone reports to Sloane that they hear sounds of combat
	They consider who is more dangerous: Tetron or Nilbog
		Tetron is a thorn, but Nilbog is the healer
	They are sure that Grisha will keep us busy
	They know that the party isn't all together
		Should they fan out to find the others?
		Not yet.
	They can see the lead ritualist's nose bleeding
	As the combat continues, the lead ritualist takes a break and someone else takes over with Sloane's permission
		Robed figure that hasn't spoken yet
		The ritualist is still not doing good
	A scream suddenly happens
	"What the fuck is that?!"
		Something is alarming them
		Something on the ceiling
	Spells start being cast
		"Looks like I'm a bit early to the party..."
			It's Kasissa!
	Another scream of pain
		As if a psychic connection is severed
Combat
	Round 1
		Alistair delays
		Grisha says that it can't allow us to rely on the automaton, it drops down to attack the automaton directly (miss and hit)
		Zaknos marks Grisha as his prey, then misses three shots with his bow
		Tetron advances into range, casts shield, and shouts to demoralize Grisha and fails
		Viola moves to get directly beneath Grisha and takes a defensive stance
		The automaton fails to shake Grisha off its sword, then turns around to slam Grisha into the wall
	Round 2
		Alistair runs over to the automaton and climbs up onto its shoulder
		Grisha struggles to escape from the pin, then swipes at Alistair and the automaton, both of which take 17 damage
		Zaknos fires four times but only hits once
		Tetron steps while reach-casting blur on the automaton
		Viola pretends to issue a fight-ending attack command to the automaton, which distracts Grisha, then moves in to throw her dagger, grazing
		The automaton continues to smash Grisha, once against the wall, and then Grisha manages to get free before getting slammed into the ground, then only cleaves off some already-broken wing
	Round 3
		Alistair leaps off the automaton to flank Grisha but misses the stab
		Grisha slashes at the automaton, disabling one of its legs with the hit, but slashes at the blur instead, then tries to climb one of the pillars, but she can't get grip
		Zaknos moves to get LoS, then fires three times, only hitting once
		Tetron moves to get a shot, then fires a telekinetic projectile, dealing the killing blow as it pierces straight through the soft flesh under her jaw
Post battle
	The automaton picks up Grisha's body and places it on the pedestal
	Tetron asks if the automaton if it's doing okay
		It nods
	Tetron says we should probably go straight to the ritual chamber
		Viola asks what about Krug and Nilbog
		Also, Alistair is a little hurt
	We open the door to the stairs
		But they're gone
	Tetron donates a healing pot to Alistair
		Doesn't get him to full
	Tetron asks if the direction that Krug and Nilbog went leads to the ritual chamber
		No
		Can it detect where they are?
			Yes, they're in the direction of the ritual chamber
	Tetron asks if the automaton can and will fight with us
		Yes
	Ready
		The automaton points its sword toward the doors to the ritual chamber
		They partially open with the weight of Grisha's body and boulders, and it jams its sword to prop them open
		The automaton charges through
The ritual chamber
	We see a huge chamber with gold and gems in the center
	Multiple people doing the ritual
	Hands lady is fucking up a mage
	Sloane and her companions are ready and take out their weapons
	It's fucking on.
