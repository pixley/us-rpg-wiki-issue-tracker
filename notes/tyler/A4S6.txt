Sunday midday
	With us having restored the portal, we inherently learn the sign
	Alistair creeps away from the rest of the party to start snooping around the outside of the cavern and the tunnelets that the water is coming from
		He eventually arrives at a point where even he has to hunch over to fit through
		He comes across various shinies
			A few coins, silver and gold
		All he can hear is the dripping of water and the sloshing of his own movements
		He comes upon a small opening
			It'd be a squeeze
			There's what appears to be a well and ancient stonework
				Inside the well, he can see some fish
			Alistair considers where he might be relative to the city above
				Probably under Timberfell
					Historical context: this would be where the initial settlement where Almas would eventually build up was
			Various treasures in the little cavern
			What was this place?
				Tiling has delicate flowers and birds
				Probably the courtyard of some wealthy family that got buried by the Rending
			Alistair wants stuff, but could be dangerous, given that no one has looted it yet
				Tough for other party members...
				He decides to approach
			The "well" has koi in it
				Koi live a long time
				Where are they getting food?
					Not obvious
			Alistair moves to go in
				WILL SAVE?!  FAILED
				As he swims down, he realizes that he can't grab the treasure because he's a koi now
	We finally notice that Alistair is missing
		We've finished the portal ritual
		He did announce that he was going to explore
		Viola: split up?
			Krug: Nah
		Process of elimination: any tunnels with shinies would be places he hadn't been
		Eventually, we find that opening
			Viola volunteers to contort her way in
			She sees Alistair's stuff at the bottom
				And other people's clothes
		Viola asks Tetron for a Detect Magic
			YES THERE'S MAGIC
		Iris asks if her expertise is required
			Viola: Yes
			Iris: Booties for Krug?
				Krug: Last resort
		Alistair-fish is swimming around to try to get our attention
			Viola asks Alistair to signal somehow
			Iris just grabs him
			Iris tries to figure out the trap
				Nope
			Iris pulls Alistair out of the water
				He doesn't change back
				She puts him back in
		Viola: We have the decanter!
			Iris: But we need a container...
			Krug: What about my plate armor?
				Viola: Better idea: Krug's boots!
			Iris remembers that she can make a scroll of Instant Pottery!
				She hands Alistair to Viola
				She starts digging through her shit to make said scroll
					It takes about half an hour
			We have a bowl, fill it with the decanter, and then 
		We still need to recover Alistair's shit
			And if we get the magic rope we can recover the chest
			Mage Hand!  Tetron and Viola have that.
			We start fishing his stuff out
		Viola: Krug needs to put the booties to help us lift stuff
			Krug: What if we tie my rope to the magic rope
			Dope, don't need the boots
		We spend the next half hour or so pulling shit out
		Alistair pops back to his original form, breaking the bowl
			He's nekkid
		Debate about ethics of turning the other koi back
		Alistair: could we disarm the trap?
			Viola: I don't know, CAN WE?
			He gives it a lookover
				Some of the tilework has magic glyphs
					Not really a good way to deal with it
		What's in the chest?
			Coinage
			Bottle with unknown contents
				Turns out to be a moderate elixir of life
			A one-foot-by-one-foot tile depicting various animals
				Birds, panthers, etc
				In the middle is a beastly looking eye
				Alistair reads aura
		Other loot
			Full plate with runes
			Two other bottles
				Tetron can't figure out what these are
			Arm bands
		More debating about what to do about other koi
			Since the stuff outside the chest was probably theirs
			If we put the fish in the chest, that breaks it once they turn back
		Alistair: if we break the trap, then they can just turn back in the pool
			Krug: We can use my folding ladder and put something at one end of it to break the tiles
				Crowbar at one end, use hammer to rap the top
		After half an hour, the koi revert
			Most of them are random small animals
			Two are human
				An old woman who starts drowning
					Alistair and Krug use the rope
				A young man surfaces immediately
		Viola starts giving them "future orientation"
			Iris is being unhelpful
		Alistair announces that he's going to wander off
			Viola tells him to look for a way out
				Just keep track of where treasure is and we can grab it on the way back
	Alistair exploring
		Not much left to look through that can fit people through
	Back at the well
		Old woman is bewildered about what happened to her son and associates
		Her name is Elsbeth, and the armored dude's name is Joffrey
		Alistair returns
		We still need a way out
		Viola: We should head back to the main chamber
	Main chamber
		Elsbeth recognizes the area as the "new temple"
		Alistair suggests that we contact someone at the university
	Alistair climbs back up and heads to Prof Lebrun's office
		Because of previous interactions, Lebrun takes him seriously
		He teleports into the cave and teleports us all back topside
			And then takes Elsbeth and Joffrey to the university
Mid-afternoon Sunday back in the city
	We get lunch
	Agenda
		Tetron splits off to chat with folks
		Viola wants to do her familiar stuff
		Krug wants to chat with Varuk
		Alistair wants to check in with Greencloaks and Tamuth House
	Alistair goes to Tamuth House
		He arrives to see construction proceeding well
		He says goodbye to the matrons
		Elwyn has a strange expression
			She hopes that her efforts were helpful
			She thinks a lot of him and hopes that he'll be safe
				He says he'll be back once we're done
		He learns of a couple of contacts in Cassomir
			Neither of them are tight connections...
			One based in Roaring Hall
				Hobgoblin
				Tamund Westover
			Other [names TBD]
				Pair
				Run Ciri and Terron Warehouse
					Something of a safehouse
				In New Codwin
			Also tangential contact with local Bellflower Network branch
	Krug heads to Varuk's place
		They were making scones
		They notice that Krug is still wearing the bandages
			So Krug decided not to get rid of the scars?
				Krug really hadn't had a lot of time to think it over
		Varuk is about to head to Oppara and then subsequently to the Jagged Saw
		Reason for asking Krug to come over
			They had a meeting with the city, and they came across some people on the way back
			The people had previously interacted with the Radiant Dawn at some point and were asking a lot of questions about us
				They were Kellids, asking all kinds of stuff, including what deities we serve
				Blonde woman and older man
					Tessra's lieutenants!
			They wanted to meet with us
			Varuk found their particular choices in language concerning
			They wouldn't tell Varuk what they wanted to talk to us about
			Krug doesn't want to leave without addressing this, since they know that Varuk is connected to us
			Where are they?
				In the forest out a ways
			How did they know that Varuk knows us?
				Varuk doesn't know
				And they seemed pretty sure about the connection when they approached Varuk
				Luckily, they don't know where Varuk lives
		Krug takes his leave, saying that he should deal with this ASAP
			Varuk apologizes for not being super available to hang out
			They are going to the art gala, though
			Varuk is happy to see Krug more relaxed from being around others
				Krug is so much more confident
			Krug takes some scones along
	Viola heads to the forest outside town
		Iris tags along
		We don't get very far before finding a cat
			It's the blonde Kellid
			Sitting in the middle of a camp with a lit fire
			Viola greets her
		A dozen or so Kellids step out
			Kemari takes lead, since Rajki doesn't speak Common
			She demands to know why we broke our promise
			Viola explains the situation around Tessra likely not stopping her warpath
			Kemari asks for us to give back Kellid items we've taken
				Viola returns
			Kemari relays this to the others
				Many among them seem content
			Kemari produces an item from behind her back
				It was given to her by Tessra's brother
				It's a symbol of Arazni
				She is here to tell us that the Kellids are no longer our enemies, for now
				She brings up "days of power" for deities
					An Araznian day of power is in two days
						Iris knows this: Iomedae's ascendence day
					She warns us about this being a potentially bad time for us
			Kemari asks if we have further business in these woods
				Viola: Yes, but we'll go somewhere else and leave you folks alone
		Iris berates Viola for probably putting her in mortal danger
			Viola apologizes and says that she didn't know that these folks would be around
		Viola throws her knife at a squirrel, robin, and a lizard
			Taking these back to the Everflowing Cavern
	At the Velour Grotto
		Iris meets Gordon for the first time
		Gordon asks whether we'd be using the services
			Iris is down for some "comfort"
			Viola is just in for the cavern
				Gordon hands her the key
		Iris makes her selection
			She wants a girl at least eight inches taller than her
				Or even multiple
			Gordon calls in various elves
				Iris books all of them
				Gordon offers on-the-house champaigne and snacks for being a friend of the Radiant Dawn
				"We don't book with time."
					THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?
		Viola lays out her materials
			Laid in a triangle:
				Feather at the top
				Scales on the left
				Fur on the right
				Blue flower at the center
			She contemplates in communion
				Reflecting on our struggles against the Aegis Coalition
				Wanting to help
				Transition from solo act to member of the Radiant Dawn
			After several hours
				Viola feels the connection stop, but she hears a sound in the water
				She opens her eyes to find a shining otter
					She greets Viola, introducing herself as a spirit of Alseta
						Newly created
						But she has no name, so she asks Viola for one
							Timpani
						She loves swimming and eating fish
					Timpani has bluish iridescence
		Iris finishes up
		Both meet in the lobby
Early evening
	Regrouping at the Birch Branch
		Krug issues his belated warning about the Kellids
			We took care of that
		Tetron suggests that we turn in for the night for early departure
			Viola: I've got stuff to do
	Viola heads to her dad's place
		Viola's mom is there in a wheelchair
			She'll be out in a few days
		Discussion about reconciliation
