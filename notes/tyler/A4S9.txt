Pre-dawn Starday
	Third watch
		Krug wakes everyone up
		Krug says that there is an opportunity for Khadija to be redeemed
			But he does admit that he believes her to be associated with the Aegis Coalition
			He doesn't see her path as being truly self-determined
		Iris does have existing Aegis Coalition knowledge
			Her parents saw them as annoying criminals
			Illegal in Cheliax, but popularity is growing
			Ten years ago, Sloane Kavrus operated in Cheliax
			The "Ego" in the signatures is definitely in reference to Egorian
		Iris: Can't let Khadija live
			Krug: What if she changes?
				Viola: Coalition members we've encountered have been dedicated to the death
			Need some kind of diversion to investigate her
				Tough to get her to leave her shit unattended
		Iris: What specifically did she say that made you sympathetic?
			Stolen away
			Reverence for nature
			Knew Amos at some point, worked with him
				Similar philosophies
				Felt Amos wants conflicting things
		Viola: Could just do a straightfoward verbal confrontation
			Krug is super on-board
		Tetron: If confrontation goes south, how do we handle correspondence?
			Might be able to go through her stuff...
		Tetron: Do we wait?
			Viola: Prob not
			Krug: She does seem to have some affinity for the area
				Could Alistair scout?
				Tetron: Probably best if we just wait
					Krug: She does seem like she might do something soon
		Iris checks to see if we're being watched: clear
		Krug: This would be the place where she wants something, so probably act soon
			Good for Alistair to scout
				Alistair: It's too dark
				Krug: I can see in the dark
					Viola: Not sneaky enough...
					Krug: Kind of afraid of there being some natural hazard
						Iris figures that this would indeed be a good area for druids
							The terrain is too vast and complex to properly interface, so it'd have to be a thing set up in advance
								Which it could be
			Tetron: We could convince the drivers to turn back for safety
				Like, now
Starday morning
	Margot pops her head out to ask what's up
		Viola explains that there was trouble ahead and that we needed to turn back
		Okay cool
	Krug sleeps more
		Tetron stays with him
	We make our way out of the pass
		Time to stop for food
			Khadija does come out to eat with the rest of us
				She seems thoughtful
	Confrontation time
		Krug and Viola come over to Khadija
		Krug asks to continue the conversation from the previous night
			She invites us into her wagon
			Tetron and Iris pile in too
		Inside the cart, she has five tarot cards on a short table
			They're the same ones that Alice did
			Also has the rest of the deck and a journal on that table
			Tetron asks if we're interrupting something
				Khadija: Not a recent one, just one I've been contemplating
					Saw it in a dream
					Felt meaningful
					Tetron considers this
						Could be super powerful magic, but it seems more divine than arcane
					Iris also considers this
						The god of prophecy is dead, and prophecies are now fluid
						This should not be possible, unless prophecy is not dead
			Khadija asks if anyone wants a drawing
				Iris: No
				Tetron: No
				Krug asks why she likes doing them?
					Khadija sees this like characters in a re-re-read book become friends
				But she doesn't do drawings with the ones set out
					She feels like they wish to be excluded
			Viola is seriously bothered and just flat out admits that we had that drawing
				Khadija: Not many put much weight into fate anymore, but this feels like the hand of the divine
					About 10 years ago, she was an apprentice
						An elder member receives...
					She drops the pretense: we know who she is
						Except
					Something has been guiding the hand of the Aegis Coalition
						On 1 Arodus 4710, the first flicker appeared in the minds who still believed
							[COPY PROPHECY HERE]
						The group has reason to read into some of this with existing context
							Aroden may yet live somehow
							Something can dim the aeon star
						See this as an opportunity to restore the natural order
							Can't let this come to pass
						Viola: what's so special about "aeon star"?
							Figuratively: a god; literally: some kind of legendary star
						Tetron: What of short-term chaos?
							Can't guess movements of the divine
						Viola: You say that like things are getting worse
							Some places are experiencing changes
								Deserts getting drier
								Lake in the north obscuring itself
								Other natural phenomena have also gone wrong
									Like a tree in the east
									Prophecies can protect as much as harm
						Tetron: How do we five fit into this?
							Initially, we didn't
							Our actions caught the attention of Amos
							If everything had gone to plan, we would have vanished on a particular boat
							Now she's having to do duties that aren't hers
							It's unfortunate Amos decided to heel-turn against the organization
								But "we have him"
					Krug: Do you wonder what your life would be like had you not been taken?
						Yes
						Hand of fate or hand of man?
					Viola: But what of the suffering left in the Coalition's wake?
						Regrettable, and by associating with them, I am condoning those choices
						Viola: Why not form a splinter group?
							Viola, Tetron, and Krug make appeals to that end
							Khadjia does a quick tarot drawing
								Past: Temperance
								Present: Hanged Man
								Future: Moon
							Khadija doesn't see a future in which her splitting off would bring about what she wants
								But her conscience would be clearer going her own way
								She will destroy the ogre's scrying eye that she's been using on us
								She's going to bounce immediately
								She will meet us in Cassomir regarding Amos's whereabouts
								We cool?
									All but Iris: yes
					Iris insists that the eye be destroyed now
						Khadija takes it out and stabs it
						Tetron pulls Iris aside
	Iris and Tetron outside
		Tetron: We need this win here
			And I absolutely will not allow Aroden to return
			Knife to the face is not the play
			I'm a tactician, working with intel
			The final stab is the one that counts
			Iris: Amos is of no concern to me
				Tetron: But the rest of us care
			Iris: I need to pray on this
				Do not let her out of your sight until I get my answer
				Tetron: Please talk to me first
			Tetron's read on Khadija: She's upset about what she's done
		Iris prays
			Response: thanks, stay your hand, but the moment she transgresses upon my name, end her
			Iris gets: minor boon and a single casting of feeblemind
		Iris looks to Tetron with a mixture of disappointment and thrill, then calmly walks back to Margot's wagon
	Back inside
		Tetron: When do you leave?
			Now
		Tetron: Is Wimberly or Margot involved with the Coalition?
			No, but Wimberly has done business with them
		Viola: What's with the code names?
			Tetron: we've got these letters
			"Keep your eyes open" makes the reader a scrying target
			Feather was grabbed by Amos
			K Ego AS: Katius is Amos's old name
				Amos is fleeing Cheliax, not just delivering
				He believes the prophecy relates to his family
					One of the lines might relate to Fleche, and he doesn't want to be part of this anymore, particularly after hanging out with us
				"A" Aegis
				"S" [TDB, Luyou forgot the word]
			S Ego AF: Sloane
				"F" financier
		Iris: Has the Coalition interacted with the Kaulfield family?
			Perhaps as enemies...
		Khadija: the colossus whose eye it is roams this area
			Great cyclops
			Tied to the "infinite threads of fate"
			Native to the area
			Driven mad by being able to see every possible future
				Which makes the eye a powerful scrying tool
			Destroying the eye probably pissed it off
			Reason for rumbling while we're on watch
		Tetron: Who else should we know about?
			Prominent member of Greyguard Castle: Chief Constable Roani Cheliff
				Taldan side of Cassomir, main fort
				Main figure there
				Coalition is funneling sleeper agents from Galt into Andoran through Cassomir
		Tetron: What's in the box?
			Don't know, don't care
		Tetron: Why watch Margot so closely?
			Her day job
		Tetron: halfling member of the coalition, has a staff or something?
			Yannick Moreau: necromancer
			Super evil
			Basically serves as Khadija's counterpart in Galt
			Advisor to Jericho
			Really the only other brains there besides Jericho
			In charge of communications
			Did the magic that took Zaknos and Nilbog
		Khadija: Everyone in the Coalition in Galt is batshit
			They consort with demons even
		Viola: what's with the blood magic?
			Primary form of communication
			She and Amos could send stuff via scrying eye
			Grunts rely on more violent means to activate it
		Khadija: Brace yourselves in case Amos is dead
			Also, Alice is part of the Coalition
		Khadija transcribes her spells for Tetron as a parting gift
	Khadija fucks off
	Margot convo time
		We took care of her problem, and ours
		We can talk more later
Afternoon backtracking
	Alistair and Iris on watch
		Growing low rumbling
	Large lumpy mass in the distance
		Smaller lumpy masses on the outcroppings
		Alistair takes out his spyglass
			Herd of fifty bison running through the pass as a group of wolves chase them
	How to protect us
		Tetron doesn't have enough time to reallocate spells
		Iris has illusory object today
			Big rock to block the path
	The stampede curves past us
		And now we start to hear anguished screams
		Feeling its way through the ravine and throwing rocks at the noises
	How to deal with the cyclops?
		No spells
		Need a distraction
			Viola is a distraction
	Viola runs to a side path and starts playing her viola as loud as she can
		The does somewhat get the cyclops' attention
		Alistair shoots at it
			It gets enfeebled 1
INITIATIVE
	Round 1
		Iris exploits vulnerability and adds personal antithesis then starts tiptoeing along the rockface
		Alistair shoots twice and moves
			Cyclops enfeebled refeshes
		Viola puts away her viola, materializes her throwing knife, futilely insults the cyclops, then retreats to the side
		Krug moves forward
		Tetron casts fly, then starts heading forward
		The cyclops grabs a boulder and throws it at where Alistair was, moves down the ravine, then senses Viola's fate, plaguing her with visions of madness
	Round 2
		Iris jumps down now that the stampede has passed, runs up to the cyclops, then stabs the cyclops' foot
		Alistair shoots twice and moves
		Viola successfully insults the cyclops, tumbles in, and delivers a finishing blow
		Krug jumps down and charges the cyclops
		Tetron flies over to a branch and casts hideous laughter
			Slowed 1, prone, no reaction, loses next turn
		The cyclops is ROFL
	Round 3
		Iris stabs three times, missing the last
		Alistair shoots twice, killing the cyclops
