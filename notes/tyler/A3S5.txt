Starday Late Morning, at Hoyert home
	Planning outside the door to the upstairs
		Viola suggests that Alistair sneaks in
			He's not there
		Zaknos checks the coffins in the stair area
			They're all empty
		Viola checks the bathroom
			Dark, no movement
		Krug opens the door
	Inside the room
		Kind of dark
		It's torn the fuck up
		Giant slug-like trails, but made of blood
			All on the walls too
		Krug approaches the first door
		Zaknos complains about not being able to see, Tetron lights the staff
		Whimpering sound from behind that first door
			Krug opens and is face-to-face with woman-like creature
				Hi Leslie
				Her lower torso is fucked up, all her entrails are out
				She's on all fours
				Blood oozes from her
				She shakes, tears at her own stomach, and shrieks
					The shriek doesn't come from her
						It comes from the dead infants in bed behind her
	INITIATIVE
		Round 1
			Krug slashes twice at Leslie, missing both times, then raises his shield
			Nilbog casts heal at Leslie, who takes half damage, then casts guidance on Krug
			Leslie lets out a bloodcurdling scream, shaking up Viola, Tetron, and Nilbog, then bites at Krug, who blocks it with his shield
			Zaknos marks Leslie, then shoots three times, missing all of them
			Alistair slides down the chimney, moves up to the doorway, then misses a stab
			Tetron casts slow on Leslie, who fails, then casts shield
			Viola has to take two tries to tumble past Leslie, then unloads a finisher
		Round 2
			Krug slashes twice at Leslie, missing both times, then raises his shield
			Nilbog casts heal at Leslie, who takes half damage, then casts shield
			Leslie turns to Viola and claws at her, grabbing her, but Krug glimpses away the damage
			Zaknos steps up onto a table, taunts Leslie, then shoots at her four times, hitting twice
			Alistair stabs at Leslie three times, only hitting once
			Tetron hits Leslie with acid arrow, then casts shield
			Viola tries twice to escape and fails, and then she takes a defensive posture
		Round 3
			Krug slashes at Leslie and hits twice, then raises his shield
			Nilbog casts heal at Leslie, dealing full damage, then runs out of range of the scream
			Leslie leans in and sucks in Viola's breath, draining her
			Zaknos takes a moment to consider the situation, determines that it is still safe to shoot, then fires twice, killing with the first hit through the mouth
	Harrison runs upstairs
		We got her
		Not safe to come in yet
		Krug helps Viola up, she talks silently
		Krug approaches the babies, as they're still undead
			Krug says that we need to take care of them
			He offers a prayer
			He pokes them each with his scimitar
		Harrison pushes in to see
			Krug verifies that it's over
		Harrison mentions that the cleric is coming tomorrow
			Dude needs some hands
				Tetron and Nilbog volunteer, on account of medicine and society requirement
			First thing tomorrow
		Harrison collapses onto the couch
			Krug apologizes that it had to come to this
				It was stressful and terrifying, hope for closure
			Harrison admits that he should have handled it better
				She didn't look like a creature - she looked like Leslie
			Krug tells him to get some rest
Out into the streets
	Viola barely gets her voice back
		She suggests that we go to Wendy
	Wendy's outside waiting for us
		She heard the screaming
		Viola invites her to sit down inside
		We explain what happened and apologize
		Wendy quietly hands over 50 gp, then leaves and heads toward the Hoyert house
	What next?
		Krug suggests that we look into the murders
			No proper lead, though
			Talk to guards?
		Viola suggests that we patch up first
		Should report to guard about the Hoyert thing...
	Guard station
		Dude there is surprised by the blood all over Viola
		We give him the all clear
			Dude is completely surprised
			Paperwork
		What about the staffing shortage?
			Dudes are over in Timberfell looking into murders
			Others out at the border
				Attacks on border towns by civvies
	Food and healing
		Zaknos suggests the place where Amos is staying
		It's crowded on the way
		We get some tables pushed together
		It's loud in here
		No talking about sensitive stuff
		Chatting
			Discuss quests
			Look into the real reason we're here?
			Viola remembers Varuk Firehair
				Context of helping Zaknos
				Krug knows them
				How to find?
					Put out posters?
					Send Alistair to gather info?
					Ask around in Liberty?
					Ask at IMG?
		Food costs 6cp
			It's dope
		Does the IMG post quests that aren't on the boards?
			Tetron says that stuff happens in Taldor
To Liberty
	Zaknos hails a carriage
		Viola, Alistair, and Tetron just walk
		Zaknos pays extra to have the carriage go fast
		Viola notices and races for it
			Alistair notices this and takes to the rooves to take a more direct route
				He activates his bracelets
	The race
		Viola weaves through a crowd and slides under a crossing carriage (she crits on the second)
		Alistair hops across gaps and has to weave through hanging laundry (he crits on the second)
		The cart weaves through traffic and swerves around the stopped carriage that Viola slid under (no crits)
		Alistair wins!
		Cart slides to a halt in front of the office
			Zaknos jumps out of the cart as it skids
		Viola loses
		Tetron comes several minutes later
	IMG building
		Not a busy day for registration
		Job board!
			Adept/regular LAP: seeking adept swimmers for gov't mission
				Same as what we saw in Augustana
				Payment has increased
			Unlicensed boats... bleh
			More info on situation in Timberfell
				List of folks to talk to about the investigation
				Ongoing for a week, it seems
		We go to the desk and persent our paperwork
			We good
			Viola asks if they have info on our investigation
				They ask to take us to a private room
			In the private room
				IMG has received info on sus activity around the city
					They captured a sus individual two weeks ago
						When interrogated, they kept quiet for the most part
						Paperwork on him referenced the 19th of Rova
							It's the Day of the Inheritor
							Almas isn't doing a big thing for it
						Viola asks if we could chat
							Dude would need to file with the Cerulean Keep, could take 3-5 days
						It wouldn't hurt to have someone who understands foreign accents
							Dude's from Galt
							Human
				Viola asks if they know where to find Varuk
					They are here
					Address in the Liberty District
				Alistair asks about the swimmer quest
					Dude chuckles
					Not something to be "taken care of"
						Can't elaborate
					For security reasons, no Chelaxians
						Zaknos barred
						Krug asks why
							The quest is related to Chelaxian activity
	To Varuk's
		Krug goes to the door
			Opens to reveal Varuk themself
			Varuk is surprised to see Krug
		We're invited in
		They make us tea
		Krug asks how Viola knew about them
			Zaugia recommendation for helping Zaknos with his contract issue
		Zaknos asks how Krug knew them
			Krug knew their mom
			His scimitar was hers
		Varuk comes back with peppermint tea
		Introductions
		Why are we here?
			Krug was surprised to hear that they were here
			Viola explains the situation with the Ashborn Company
			They don't have much experience, but they've heard stories from their mother
			They also have contacts within the city
				One in the military that could be of great help
					Would be calling a favor from Varuk
					Unlikely to be able to drum up support, but is effective on his own
					Likely pro bono
					Bald orc with an eyepatch
					Good dude
					Name: Kuktun Mimya
				Another friend who originally referred them to Zaugia
					Trusted
					Difficult to work with
					Would come at the cost of a favor
					Goblin, despite long name
					Hard to find, suggest caution when finding on our own
					Name: Wolfgang Beltracchi
					Has a receding hairline, sensitive about it, don't bring it up
					Dapper fellow, dresses in a style not unlike Tetron's
				Alistair asks who's more effective
			Zaknos mentions the soul fragment thing
				If we dissolve the company, he'd get the fragment back
			We cede scheduling decision to Zaknos
				He suggests tomorrow since Tetron and Nilbog will be tied up
		Krug asks what brings Varuk to Almas
			There are a lot of misconceptions about orcs, especially those from the Hold
			Taldor has had recent strides in making accords, but other countries are kind of behind
			Wants to encourage cooperation and trade
			Some tribes aren't into it, but most are on-board, especially Mahja
			Next stop is Taldor
				Recent change in power provides opportunity to make inroads
			Almas just another stop along the way
		Krug mentions that he's headed the same way
			Looking for friends, though some are headed back to Lastwall
				Does Varuk know what's going on with that?
					Heard rumors
					Folks of a few faiths, esp Iomedae, have been receiving calls to return to Lastwall to confront with some emerging threat
					None for them as a follower of Sarenrae
		Varuk asks to speak with Krug privately
			They've learned something
			They know that Krug is uncomfortable with the scars
			There's a place in Almas that offers a ritual to remove those
				Costs money
				Only physical, no mental
				They primarily do gender services
			Krug asks for the location
				It's run by the church of Abadar
			They only mention it because they care about Krug, not that they have any particular opinion about the matter
			Krug admits that he'd need to consider it, since there's a lot of weight behind it
	We decide to go look into the murders
To Timberfell
	Timberfell is pretty quiet, unsettlingly so
	Folks loitering
	Not a lot is going on
	Folks seem super distrustful of us
	Guards are going around, trying to interview people, folks aren't talking
	As we get to the end of the bridge, the way is blocked by a Consortium guard
		Dude laughs at us and lets us in
		Dude brushes Krug off when he asks if he knows anything
	We see the gnome from the ship looking all pissed
		Seems to be supervising
		Viola approaches while he's yelling about needing to use "alternative methods"
		He recognizes us and demands that we leave
			Viola argues with him
		Alistair sneaks over to the cop he was yelling at
			Dude flips through his files and points to a name and location
			Name is Portia Bulso (one of the Consortium guards)
				Not a victim of an attack, but one of the first responders to one
		Viola is able to distract him through argument
			Dude does a whole "don't you know who I am?" thing
			His name is Sirran Tahseen
