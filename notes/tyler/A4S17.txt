Toilday evening
	At the Vaylens'
		Roles
			Viola - handmaiden
			Krug - coachdriver
			Iris - footman
			Alistair - Iris's underling
			Tetron - attendant
		Stashing our stuff
			Can Tetron bring his staff?
				Viola: It's awfully flashy
				Iris can stash it in her prosthesis
			Viola is stashing her rapier in her gloves of storing
			Iris can just hide her prosthesis with a glove
			Iris: We should leave our stuff at Hosetter
			Viola: Is there a spell that can hide magic signatures?
				Yes, but it's risky because we can't guarantee that the person scanning is less powerful than Tetron
			Leaving Taranis and Timpani behind
		Vaylen Parlor
			The family is doing their final prep
			Tetron is handed a large stack of gift boxes
			Tetron knows that the subject of the celebration won't arrive/appear normally, but instead will make a grand entrance at some point in the evening
			Viola is given the Margot's arm
				Margot asks how our prep went
					Couldn't figure out a good way to sneak our shit in, so natural talent
					She doesn't get a chance to respond
			Vaylen higher-up gives warning to all that we need to be on our best behavior
		Vaylen Stables
			Same behavior warning
			May have to escort early departures
			Will have to do various tasks, so listen for instructions
	Trip over
		Margot's fiance is talking everyone's ears off
		No opportunity to ask Margot questions
	Arrival at Bain Manor
		Upstairs windows are curtained shut, which is weird
			Can see guards peeking out every so often
		We see check lines
			One for servants, one for mercs
				Servants are checked more rigorously
			Viola and Margot go first
				Viola's gloves get pinged
					They ask to see the contents
						Flying Heron is cleared
			Tetron and Vaylen second
				Tetron has no magical items on his person
			Iris's prosthesis pings
				They don't care
			Alistair sneaks his tools and a wand past the check
			Krug brought his lifting belt
				Approved
		Into the manor, ground floor
			Tetron sets down the gifts in the foyer
			Intimate dining area
			Tetron and Viola stand behind the Vaylens' party
			Baron Sirram Bain is present
				Greeting guests
				Has a dragon wing pin on his lapel
			Woman seated next to the baron
				Sitting, not greeting folks
				Just looking at people, menacingly
				Probably the baroness
				Top-to-bottom black dress with red accents
				Wearing gloves with long pointy fingertips
			Kyphon is absent
		Over at the back area for servants
			Head servant brings Krug, Iris, and Alistair over there
			Family dining room acting as staging area for the appetizer course
			For now, just hang tight and stay out of trouble
		Dining room
			Food begins coming out
			The baron gives a welcome speech
			Tetron looks around to identify guests
				Some military guests
				Major families represented
					Prialla
					Diborge
						Vaylens are seated with them
				The Kaulfields are here
				He gives Viola the rundown
			Lots of conversation around Margot's engagement
		Servants
			They're made to help stage the next course
			Iris manages to catch a glimpse of her parents through a door
			Alistair gets the chance to read some lips
				The Bains are talking to each other
					The Baroness says that it's an hour-thirty until "he's ready"
					Baron: On-schedule
		Dining room
			Margot gets Viola's attention during the third course
				From this point on, tap Margot's foot to give the signal that it's time to be dismissed
			More courses come out
				About 45 minutes pass
				Tetron keeps an eye out for odd happenings/discussions
					Basically everyone except Margot's fiance is doing secondary stuff
						Some keeping notes of their interactions
						Guards are eavesdropping
						The Bains are also eavesdropping on others
						Clear lipreading or magical listening
						He catches the baroness's name: Isadore
					As far as he can tell, no one is paying us much mind
						EXCEPT ISADORE
						At some point, Isadore has a servant accost Tetron
							She noticed that Tetron has a tanline where a beard would be
								He explains that he had been in Andoran for a time
								This seems satisfactory to the servant, but Isadore is still somewhat sus
		Servants
			Krug is instructed to bring the gifts upstairs, alongside three other men
				Guards step aside to allow them up
				Instruction: enter Kyphon's room, drop gifts off, and leave immediately
				Krug's packages are weirdly heavy
				Kyphon's bedroom
					Beautiful but sterile
					Large chests at either end
					Writing desk
					A sealed letter is on the bed, addressed to Kyphon from his parents
					Reptile-themed decor
					Kyphon is somewhere else
						And it doesn't seem like he'd be anywhere else upstairs
				Krug has a moment to neatly arrange his cargo
					Krug carefully pokes the letter, nothing happens
						He yoinks it
			Alistair has been made to wheel a cart of desserts
				Something taped to the bottom of only one glass
					He can tell that this is meant for Kyphon's seat
					There's a guard in this hall, but he's there to keep folks upstairs
					He swaps the glass with the one meant for Marquisse Kaulfield
		Dining room
			Marquisse Kaulfield takes the note, stashes it into a compact, then takes it out to powder her nose and try to read it
				Tetron and Viola can read it through a mirror: "Your son is ready to greet you."
				She summons a servant, who immediately heads to the back
		Servants
			Everyone is gathered
				Potential breach in security
				Person of interest is described as a male ganzi
					Iris realizes that this matches her pre-transition self
		Dining room
			Mercs are led out of the room
		Upstairs
			Iris and Alistair are escored room-to-room
			Servants' Quarters is searched first
				Several traps and hazards disarmed and rearmed along the way
					ALISTAIR GETS TO WATCH
			Some kind of armory/library
				Alistair doesn't get the chance to find anything incriminating
				Iris notices a reading nook
					Largest window in the house besides the foyer
					The window can open
					It's trapped: acid ready to hit the latch
					Wallpaper has been rubbed away on either side of the window
					Etchings on the windowsill: arrows (forward, left, forward, right), the letter C, dragon's head, dragon wings, dragon tail
			Kyphon's room has been secured
			Multiple guards in the master suite
				Warning from guards: don't touch stuff
				Alistair keeps an eye out for recently-written material
					Finds a rack for ink to dry on
						One note at the top: Letter from Kaulfields to Bains
							Describing their search for their son
							Asking for anything helpful
							Glad for good business interactions
							Iris likely to be travelling with others
				Alistair also spots plenty of traps
				Iris looks for any religious iconography, suspecting some kind of cult bent to the baroness
					She spots an abstract-looking tapestry
						Like a family portrait, but with symbols representing family members
							Shimmering green symbol of a multiple-headed draconic thing: likely of Tiamat
							Some sort of deity that is into mutilation and recombination: Lamashtu
							Looks like they're forming an alliance, with blood dripping to a multichromatic draconic creature
						She realizes that there's a connection between the Kaulfields' water stuff and the Bains' time shit
							Her parents must be providing powerful water magics to the Bains' work
							EITHER you'd need a lot of time to do stuff OR use time magic to accelerate stuff
								Which means that her parents likely aren't sticking around in Cassomir for long
		Garden
			Krug led past a bunch of topiaries of various designs
				There's a life-size topiary depicting an adult dragon
				Otherwise, he just goes around like he's looking for someone
		Dining room
			Break before coffee and tea
			We have the chance to mingle
		Servants' area
			Catching each other up
				Alistair denies having done anything regarding the note
				Tetron slips Alistair his drawing of Kyphon's draconic form
				Krug gives Alistair the letter he got in Kyphon's bedroom
				Alistair relays info about Bains' knowledge of Iris
				Iris warns about potential Lamashtu connection
			Should we slip the drawing of Kyphon to someone?
				Someone gossipy...
				But not Lord Vaylen, he's too much
				The Prialla have a rivalry with the Vaylens
			Alistair goes for a bathroom break
				Reads the letter
					Congratualtions for his hard work
					The pain will be worth it
					Ready to receive a signet ring
					Soon will be able to go to a hoard
						Can consume something there to gain knowledge
				Include the letter with the drawing!
				Tetron enters
					He starts to ask what the deal is before Alistair uses his wand of invisibility
			Invisible Alistair slips the papers under Lady Prialla's dish
		Dining room
			Coffee and wine are brought in
			Kyphon's entrance is neigh
			Lady Prialla acknowledges the "secret note" aloud
				She turns to her husband with this
				A servant notices, tells another, then the other exits the room
				A moment later, guards surround the room, a servant tells Lady Prialla that she has a message
					She's led out of the room and basically immediately bopped and taken to the basement
			Viola taps Margot's foot to be dismissed
		Servants' area
			Viola invites the others downstairs
			Alistair wants to pass a message to Lord Prialla to warn him about his wife first
				No writing here...
				Guess he should use a message spell
			Iris considers the directions she saw in the library
				Didn't get a good enough look at the garden to see the corresponding path
		Dining room
			Alistair sends the message
				Alistair turns away like nothing
				Lord Prialla charges past, knocking over Alistair's cart
					He demands to know what the hell is going on
		COMMOTION TIME
			Tetron gets to watch arguing and the Bains get annoyed by the events unfolding
			Margot asks Tetron if he knows where Viola is
				Convening
				She wonders whether she and the Vaylens leave
					Tetron recommends that she follow the Bains' lead
			Lady Vaylen is freaking out
				Margot and her fiancee are trying to calm her
			Meanwhile, Lord Prialla throws a coffee cup at the Bains' table
				Baroness Bain walks up to him, puts her hand on his shoulder, and he collapses on the floor
			Iris gathers folks
				We should go to the garden
				But she hears something: hollow clicks, from something alive, then a scream, then meat
					But fuck the noble bitch
			Priallas' guards are ready to throw down
		Garden
			No one here
			Iris goes to the point beneath the library window
				She follows the instructions and ends up in a random topiary maze
					And then she remembers to activate her winged boots to overlook the maze
					She finds a bit in the center and there's a stone bench
						She notices engravings
							Flower motifs and a slight indentation at a crocus flower
							She presses the indentation
								Something in the garden has moved
				She flies back to the party
					The dragon topiary has risen to reveal a space beneath
			TO THE DRAGON
				Check head, wings, and tail
					Iris finds them
						Switch in roof of dragon's mouth
						Button scale in the center of the back
						Button scale at the end of the tail
					Heavy door opens
						It's loud, but there's shennanigans inside the house
						Shaft straight down to some kind of a lab with a stasis tube in the middle
							200 foot drop
							Kyphon is inside
							There's an hourglass that is nearly empty
					Iris gives Tetron his staff
						Can we fly?
							Didn't prepare
							But has Rewinding Step
								If he goes down, he can pop back up
									SABOTAGE!  SABOTAGE!
						Iris's chaotic magic includes Spider Climb today!
							SEND ALISTAIR!!!
		In the dungeon
			Kyphon's bigger and has wings now
			Some dead bodies
			Chests
			Books
			Golden protected circle
			Statues holding battle axes and mauls
				They look up as soon as Iris, Tetron, and Alistair enter
			Tetron inspects the ritual setup on the way down
				In the stones in the floor, there are wires embedded
					Cutting these will fuck shit up
			INITIATIVE
				Round 1
					Axe automaton approaches Iris, swings both axes in one movement (hit), then uses the axes to pin Iris in place
					Iris ponders the automaton, exploits weakness (10 fire), then attacks (hit)
					Alistair runs behind the axe automaton, grabs a torch, and smacks the automaton with it (hit)
					Maul automaton gets between the party and the chests, then swipes Iris and Tetron
						It misses wildly and cracks Kyphon's tank
					Tetron casts Cone of Cold at the floorwork, then circles around Kyphon's tank
						Brakish red liquid starts to seep out of the floor
					MEANWHILE, up top
						A fight has broken out in the foyer
						The Kaulfields have fucked off
						Vaylens are still in the dining room and uninvolved
						Krug asks Viola if they should intervene
							Viola: If fight spills into dining room, we charge in
				Round 2
					Axe automaton pulls its axes out of Iris, then throws one of its axes at Alistair past a pillar (hit), then throws the other one (miss)
					Iris creates a duplicate, then resolves the duplication into a flanking position, then stabs (miss)
					Alistair steps around the pillar and spellstrikes the axe automaton with the torch (CRIT), killing it
					Maul automaton is blocked by its dead ally, so it loops around to Tetron at the other side of the tank, and then swings its mauls at him (crit)
					Tetron step-casts Cone of Cold to hit both the floor and the automaton (fails save), then makes himself invisible
					MEANWHILE, up top
						People are grabbing the Prialla daughter
							Do we save the kid?  Yeah...
						Viola enters the house holding the gem box like freaking Troy from Community
							Krug follows suit
							Quick consultation: Viola get the Vaylens out, Krug charge and save the kid
				Round 3
					Iris runs over to the maul automaton, then stabs it (hit)
					Alistair Warp Steps to flank with Iris, then swings the torch (miss)
					Maul automaton turns to Alistair and swings (nat 1), hitting the tank, then swings twice more (miss, miss)
						Any further damage will break the tank
					Tetron casts Lightning Bolt to fuck up the rest of the floor, then moves away from the automaton
						No longer invisible
					MEANWHILE, up top
						Viola enters the dining room and tells the Vaylens that it's time to leave
							Margot suggests breaking the window, and Viola obliges
							And we're out
						Krug tackles the guard holding the kid, grabs her, then makes his way out the door, body-checking folks along the way
						Fuck the cart
				Round 4
					Iris stabs (hit, miss, miss)
					Alistair swings the torch (miss, hit), killing the automaton
			Cleanup
				Iris grabs the automaton's axes and jams the door with them
				All three work together shove an automaton's body to also block the door
				Tetron blinks out
				Alistair inspects the chests
					Locked, Alistair picks
					Two tries to unlock north chest
						Fancy robes
						Ornate dagger with dragon motifs with a rune
						Shield with rune
						Pair of large scaly boots
					One try to unlock south chest
						Evil-looking wand
						Robe-like thing
						Swamp-colored potion
						Several scrolls
					He wraps the stuff in a robe and ties it to his back
					Climbing out
				Tetron wants to close the thing
					Same sequence doesn't close it
					Reverse sequence closes it
					He casts Lightning Bolt to attempt to fry the mechanism
				Guards exiting the building now
				Tetron casts more Lightning Bolts as he runs away
