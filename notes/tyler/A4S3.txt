Oathday, late morning, at SunnySide
	Room assignments
		2F - Master bedroom (w/ balcony) - Tetron and Iris
		3F - Top bedroom - Viola (one unoccupied bed)
		3F - Left bedroom - Krug (one unoccupied bed)
		4F - Top bedroom - Zaknos and Nilbog
		4F - Bottom bedroom - Alistair
	Planning for fight with Ashborn Company
		Could we get Dorfinn out early for this?
			Kuktun would be "supervising" him
		Weaknesses and resistances
			Good damage for all is out-of-reach economically
			Tetron has the four silversheen he made before
				We decide to get more to cover Viola's throwing knife, some of Alistair's arrows, and Zaknos.
					Alistair is able to get a steep discount from Belladonna.
		Coordinate with Chimpy
			Viola: time to help Zaknos once and for all.  Ask to bring the bosses here
			Chimpy poofs away to fetch Janice
				Janice is pissed to hear that we'd like to skip the paperwork
				Tetron asks whether there's a process for expiditing it
					Janice asks for a bribe
						Viola says that she'll never have to see Chimpy again if we can be seen tonight
	Gathering forces
		NO WE ARE NOT TAPPING HANDS LADY
		Kuktun
			We arrive at the Cerulean Keep
			He reports that he's gathered a handful of trusted subordinates
				He might be able to get a few volunteers from outside his unit
		University students
			Two students are sent to us
				Fancy-looking Taldan man - Dalton - has aerial support via magical crossbow
					Here for his creature-hunting capstone
					Asks for letter of recommendation at the end
					Tetron checks to see if dude has defensive measures
						They're staying far away and keeping together
				Upper-class tiefling man - Halzar - battlefield aid
					Interested in contact with their heritage
						Tetron asks whether the fact that this is combat could prove problematic
							Their own devil ancestors have been slain
					Capstone about connection of tieflings with their diabiolic
				Tetron can tell that both are kind of green
		Divine assistance
			The blessing Viola got can apply to any of us
				She'll set it off
		Omerta
			Alistair goes to contact them via the Greencloaks
			He and Stareye are brought to a secret location, an unassuming house, via magic
			Four individuals (and a cat) enter the room
				Beltracci - appears as Varuk described
				Cloaked woman with white hair and a cat - the only one smiling
				Dude who looks like if Tetron were 20% more of a dick
				Large orc woman with metal armor, standing directly behind Beltracci
			Beltracci acknowledges our service to Udella
				Omerta always pays back their debts
				He is able to lend us the services of one of his associates
				If the participant is brought back in one piece, the debt is considered paid
			Alistair asked which of them is 
				The cloaked woman introduces herself as Lorelei, the dick guy as Grimaldi, and the orc as Udella
				Lorelei and Grimaldi are both casters
					Lorelei is more of a social manipulator and support
					Grimaldi is a combat support
					Both can do damage
				Udella and Beltracci are both martials
				Alistair turns to Stareye, saying that he's partial to Grimaldi, but asks for a second opinion
					Stareye asks whether there will be negotiation
						No
						Okay, yeah, Grimaldi
				Stareye says that it looks like he's working with Grimaldi again
				Stareye prompts Alistair to show respect to Beltracci as they leave
		Dorfinn
			Alistair goes to inquire
				He heads for Major Zenza
				She is happy to see him
				He asks whether she is aware of our operation against devils
					She is, she was the one to grant leave
				Alistair asks if Dorfinn could be made available to help, even though his paperwork is still processing
				Zenza is doubtful that it would be allowed
					Since he is a ward of the state, should he come to harm, the state would be liable
					Alistair asks if Dorfinn could waive this liability
						Zenza allows him to ask Dorfinn if he's amenible to it
				Alistair arrives at Dorfinn's cell
					Fills him in, mentioning that we're leaving town soon
					Dorfinn agrees to help and to waive
				Zenza accepts the waive
					She tells Alistair that Dorfinn'll be sent along to Kuktun's group
	Location scouting
		Viola proposed using the old hideout Dorfinn and Sloane shared a while ago
			Krug is able to fully stand up
			Rooms carved out of sewer walls
			Ceilings are low enough to negate flight advantage
		Dorfinn knowledge?
			Any traps or secret passages to take advantage of?
				Seems like all traps have been disabled
					Are still present, but not great against fliers
				One vertical shaft would be a good place for forces to hide, but not super useful unless main fight is in the sewers proper
		Tetron
			Any spell requests?
				Iris interrupts to give a split medallion to Krug
					Gives touch spell connection - LOH!!!
		Kuktun's forces arrive
			Dorfinn in tow
			Alistair recognizes his friend Thomas among them
			Tahseen is here also
				He's here to demonstrate the sincerity of his apology
			Vabul Irontarn has also tagged along
		Cyrus, Namira, and Nilus are here for support
		Grimaldi shows up without any fanfare
		The students show up
			They approach Tetron, asking if there's anything specific they should be made aware of
				Immunities and resistances mentioned
				Invisibility probable
		Positioning
			There's a lecture hall of sorts that would be a good initial area as far as the "negotiation" facade
				But it's one-way-in
			We could use the central intersection
				But the water channels would make navigation 
		Chimpy Intel
			Janice will arrive first to make sure the area is secure
				And then will give a "presenting" announcement
			The company is pretty large
			The three erinyes leaders would definitely be here
				Astrid's specialty is that she's fueled by rage
					Can make enemies fight each other
				Halea conjures darkness
				Reanne uses blinding light
			Bone devils and spine devils summoned in case of issues arising
			Attorney also brought along for the negotiation
				Can also fight
			Viola asks what *really* annoys the erinyes
				Halea is always pissed
				Reanne hates when her friends are insulted
				Astrid hates when people don't follow through on things
			Other notes
				Astrid sometimes hazes people by making them shit themselves
			What will Janice be looking for?
				Traps, other sus shit
		Chimpy has a concern
			He thinks that if the Ashborn Company dissolves, he dies
			We chat about that for a while, and we decide to give a letter of intent for him to be employed by the Radiant Dawn
Evening arrives
	Starting to take positions
		Party and Chimpy at central intersection
		Military folks and Grimaldi hiding in a blocked-off storage room

	Bringing in the help first

			She's a devil or tiefling carrying Zaknos's contract

		Zaknos doesn't know what he's supposed to be doing
			Viola volunteers herself and Tetron to represent Zaknos

					THE FUCK?!
		Tetron proposes his own alternative: Astrid
