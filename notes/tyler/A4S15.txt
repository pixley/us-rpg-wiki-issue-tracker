Moonday midday
	Viola notices something really off
		Similar sensation to looking at a wall of art where everything is slightly crooked
		She tells everyone to stop
			Everything is wrong
			But she doesn't know what
			Felt it for the briefest moment
			But she doesn't know what it is
				Iris considers it
					She doesn't know
			Tetron asks if he can help
				Detect magic?
					Nothing
	Continuing discussion with Borgon
		Tetron: What do you remember?
			Part of a caravan
			Had to split off after receiving news
			Travelled alone for a day and a half
			Got ambushed
			Family abducted
				Borgon escaped
					Amos yeeted his cage
			Tracked them all the way to Cassomir, last saw them crossing the Steelcross Bridge
			Shot down and rendered unconscious
				Woke up at Roaring Hall
		Alistair: Details on ambushers
			Wearing all black
			Quite a number of them
			Captured Fleche gently, roughed up Amos and Alice
			Not necessarily allowed to say more
				Viola: We know Amos and Alice are with the Coalition
					Oof
		Coalition deets
			They were planning on offering Fleche as a sacrifice
				Second thoughts
				They've been dodging the Coalition for a bit so that they don't have to go through with it
			Viola: What places do the Coalition operate out of
				Don't know, was never brought along
					Had to keep an eye on Fleche instead
					Did go to the Citadel, though
						Viola: We do already know that a higher-up on the Taldan side of town is Coalition
			Tetron: Ever go to Quickfall Abbey?
				Some activities performed there
					Large quantities of sacrificial materials brought
				He sometimes went to ponder his second thoughts
		Borgon introduces himself to Iris
			Acknowledges Iris's affiliation with Arazni
				"Fortuitious that Amos turned before you joined"
		Tetron: What work did he do for the Coalition?
			Advocated for mortals being better with the guiding hand of fate
				Raised money with this propaganda
				Viola: any particular contacts?
					No names, but they have a large house with large topiaries
						In Amber Trellace, but not Vaylen Manor, at least as far as we know
							Viola: Trivial for Taranis
		Tetron: Amos has his own goals, but what does Borgon want?
			Sunflower seeds, his family, a fat rat...
	Moving forward
		Borgon volunteers to accompany one of us to provide an extra Drain Bonded Item
			Tetron takes him
		Identify target home
		Snoop around Quickfall Abbey
			Alistair suggests to look around at night instead
		Alistair wants to help the Silver Squires in Cur's Tooth
			Alistair invites Krug
			Alistair also intends to spread the info that Patia is down for the prosthetic deal
			Also chat with Tariq
To Amber Trellace!
	Bright clear autumn day
	We smell flowers
	We happen across Margot sitting at a pavilion with several others
		Looks like the Vaylens are having tea
		They don't seem to notice us
		Tetron finds the fact that an entire noble family having tea publicly odd
			Like they're showing off
		Margot is masking concern with trying to look interested
			Tetron wants to chat anyway
			But Iris can read lips
				Countess is standing, quoting something and inserting her own talking points
					Piles of letters next to her, that she's reading from
					Zandriele is her first name apparently
					They're being invited to a coming-of-age party for Kyphon Bain
						Congrats for the marriage offered too
						20 Lamashan, Toilday
							LITERALLY TOMORROW
						She tells her son that this will be a good opportunity to network
						Margot is told that she'd need to bring a handservant and other stuff
						Apparently, they'll need to bring a magic item along to the Bain thing
						Tetron is aware of how big a deal of coming-of-age parties are among Taldan nobles
							Fucking family political bloodbath
		Tetron wants to message her
			He slightly startles her
			He asks to speak with her at some point this evening
			She suddenly also has need to speak with us
				She will be at Isamacco Courtyard tonight
				Dope
	Tetron asks Borgon to guide us to the target house
		We find ourselves at a grand, yet moody home
			It's clearly locked magically
			It's also dead silent
			Viola: If I had money, I'd bet that this is the Bains' house
				Iris: Does this make the coming-of-age a trap?
					Probably
				Viola: What would be funny is if we unmasked the Bains during the party
					Borgon is having none of that
	Borgon makes fun of us for having no money
		Viola: Oh, yeah, we were going to go to the IMG office
At the IMG office
	Adept-only stuff
		Jalina Gillies is looking for security 
			Marina's Catch
		Quest at the Great Eye
			Looking for someone to investigate "editing of liminal space"
		Inquiry by S. Lackrock
			Search-and-rescue outside the city
		House Cypria is looking for someone to help with a livestock issue at their fishery
	Adept stuff all looks multi-day; what else?
		Viola notices something paying pretty well
			Asking to embarass someone publicly
			300 gp
			Last name DeVorge
		Elenor posting about her sister's murder
		Poisoning of potions
			Test/recall entire stock of a specific item
	Other random notes
		Innkeeper inquiring about a person with strange marks on their bones
		Warning about Chateux [unknown] being haunted
		Selling a Lucky Halfling's Foot
		Merc contracts
		Art exhibit in Oppara
		Pending trial for Sabrina Pierce on Starday
		Request for info regarding a missing noble
			Last seen near Brumangia Wilds
	News
		Mercs in low supply
		Old report on Currant's attack on Agrimony
		Weasel pop rise in Augustana
	Welp, now what?
		A bunch of stuff that is multi-day
		Viola: I might as well look into the Pierce thing
		Iris: Want to grab Krug and Alistair and look into Murkback Keep
			Likely candidate for either Amos or Kaulfields
			Yeah, let's do it
In Cur's Tooth
	Alistair and Krug poulticing and bandaging
	The others show up
		The Silver Squires are interrupted by Iris before they can ask if we're here to help
			They thank Alistair and Krug and offer their assistance in the future
	Rewind to Alistair's convo with Tariq
		No news on Amos
		News on Kaulfields!
			Many large magical goods being brought to a certain household
				Seem to be components related to transmutation
				A large estate: It's the Bains
				Afterward: We fill Alistair and Krug in on what we learned
	We want to go to Murkback Keep
To Murkback Keep!
	As we approach, we see how large a structure it is
		It's shockingly quiet for how close it is to other stuff (Port Authority)
	No posted guards
		No anybody
	Tetron detects magic the whole way
		Various magical tools
		Nothing hidden
	Tetron's knowledge of the keep
		Originally built when Cassomir was small
		Currently run by Schmad Blackrock
			The search-and-rescue quest
				Which means dude is still here
					Viola: Which means that it's unlikely that Amos or the Kaulfields are here
	We knock
		Someone peeks through an peephole and asks who's there
			Viola: We're a LAP asking about the quest
		Blackrock lets us in
			He's a tiny gnome with indigo hair
			He introduces himself, insisting egalitarian treatment
			His men left some time ago and haven't come back
				Should have returned about 12 days ago
				He's here by himself
			They're pretty far outside the city
				Went to Slatedown to secure cargo, as the road to/from can be stalked by monsters
					Cargo is largely crops
					Coal, clay, peat, and such additionally
			Tough to traverse the area without local knowledge and boating skills
				Oof
				Tetron: But you have those
					Yes, but if he goes, then no one can watch the Keep
						No one?
						Well, he has a son, but he's a known thief
			Tetron has more questions
				Does the keep house travelers?
					Other than rats and racoons, no
				Any times where someone might sneak in?
					He does not leave ever
				How far down does the keep go?
					Very
					He has the keys
					Alistair: When was the last time he checked that it hasn't been opened?
						Occassionally checked, but not often
						Tetron: Iris likes catacombs, can she see?
							Sure!
	Down to the catacombs
		Viola chides Tetron for the bad cover story
		We walk around
			Tombs, vaults, and a place of reverence for the previous generations
				Specifically important that members of the organization are interred here
			We're pretty damn sure there's no one here
		Tetron: Are there other catacombs around?
			Yes!  Sprawling network under an old abbey
			Brumangia Wilds also has some
			Amber Trellace
			Almost certainly none beneath the Andoren side of the city
Meeting with Margot
	She's holding a box
	She says she doesn't have a lot of time
		House Vaylen has a strict schedule
	Her box is the container that contains her wedding gifts
		Necklace, ring, and brooch set
		If we do come to the coming-of-age thing, we will need it
			She assumes we overheard
			We will have to be in the room with the rest of her family
			We will be sent to the servants' quarters during the dance
				This will be our opportunity to snoop around
			She is aware of their efforts in gathering illicit goods
				Temporal stuff, particularly
	Tetron: How much should we tell her?
		Viola: Yeah, Lord Bain's a dragon
			She's not surprised
	Note: Individuals at the party will be dangerous
		Generally nobles
		Please use discretion
			Definitely disguise
				Tetron can't have his beard showing as a "servant"
	Her cover for us to snoop is for us to go pick up the box, having been "forgotten"
		She firmly believes that the basement is where sus shit is going on
	Tetron: Does she know the invite list?
		Local major families, but only known through public word-of-mouth
		Likely business associates
	She warns that there is absolutely no way that we can start a fight
	Margot leaves
		Further planning
			Viola: How do we deal with Krug?  This is a big lie.
To Quickfall Abbey!
	Definitely abandoned, though it looks like some folks come by from time to time to do some minor upkeep on graves and the like
	Alistair and Iris start looking for signs of presence
		Iris is distracted by a set of gravestones that has a last name she knows of
		Alistair follows various tracks
	For a brief moment, Iris feels a hand touch her, but no one's there
		She's standing at the grave of an Ivara
			Old Taldan family
		She rejoins the party
	Tetron asks if Borgon can feel Amos
		Nope
		Which means that Amos isn't here unless the catacombs here are a mile deep
			But he could feel him earlier today when we were in the Amber Trellace and near Murkback Keep
			We should see if we can establish a triangulation
				But that can be for later
	Alistair looks for a way down
		A couple appear to have been used somewhat
			We randomly pick one
	Windy circular staircase into a wine cellar
		Alistair looks for secret passages
			Just a potato cellar
		No magic here either
	Next path
		Larger set of stairs that descends quite a ways
			For ages
			It's a trick!
				Viola looks back and sees the top of the stairs
			We attempt to disbelieve the illusion
				But how to we pass?
					Alistair closes his eyes and feels along the wall
						Success
		Into a narrow hallway
			Have to walk single-file
				Krug first, then Alistair
			Doors at the far end
			Alistair looking for traps
				Finds 6 grooves along the floor and walls
					And a pressure plate that runs the whole length
			Alistair has everyone back up so that he can try the disarm more safely
				He makes a few attempts and accidentally sets if off
				The floor slides out to reveal ghostly hands waiting to pull down
					But Alistair grabs the edge and pulls himself up
			So now there's a giant hole
				Alistair could reset, but the hands would grab at him
					Tetron uses mage hand to test if the hands can detect invisible stuff
						They can't
					Tetron makes Alistair invisible
				Alistair manages to reset it, then disables it
			Now we're at the doors, four on each side
				Hallway ends after the doors
				Alistair doesn't find any traps
					But we're still sus
						Tetron uses mage hand to start opening doors
							Door 1: Crates of dried herbs
							Door 2: Barrels and a dead guy amongst them
								Dude is wearing Andoren blues, dead for a few days
								Staring toward the door we came through
								Tetron mage hand grabs the dude's badge
								Other than death smells, iron and gunpowder
								We go to close the door
									As it closes, the body animates
										"Snooping around in the dark, are we?  How quaint."
										The voice refuses to identify itself
							Door 3: Two hanging guard bodies
								Take those badges too
								More taunting by the voice
							The rest of the doors: Supplies, more bodies
								Six badges total from dead guards
							Last door: A table with a ritualistic circle on top
								Tetron inspects it, but he doesn't determine much other than it being the animating method
								Iris: Then this probably means that the caster is here
									Tetron casts see invisibility
										He sees an old man squatting in the corner
						We dogpile the invisible man
							He surrenders
							Paid to be down here by "wealthy people"
								Claims to not know much else
								Viola sees through it
									He admits to "just liking corpses"
									"Hobbyist necromancer"
										He admits to the undead not being willing
											Iris hates this
									A religious organization paid him to wait for a group and take vengeance against them
									Also, the hall is going to fill with water
								Iris stabs the shit out of him
									Then we grab his employment docs and leave
										Specifically waiting for the Radiant Dawn
			Have to climb back up the stairs against gushing water
	Back at the top
		The water is just being conjured from thin air
			It stops once the stairwell fills
	Next path
		Wide staircase
			Can go down two wide
			Smell of rot as we descend
				Viola, Alistair, and Iris get nauseous
		Fungal infestation room at the bottom
			NOPE
			And nothing of interest anyway
				Except Krug sees something in the back that isn't mushrooms
					Tetron mage hands, tries to lift it, but it's too heavy
					He brushes away some of the fungus
						It's a barrel
							Screw that
	Last path
		Looks to be a residence of sorts
		Two doorways, light coming under the door of one
			Alistair listens at the lit one, but he can't hear anything
			Iris listens at the unline one, but she can't hear anything either
			Alistair drops to the floor to peek under the lit door
				Hardwood floor
				Furniture feet
			Viola: Check for traps and bust in?
				Alistair finds a trap
					Disarm successful
					Small metal snake killed
				Tetron checks the other one: it's also trapped
					Alistair sets off the other, but we don't know what it did
				We open the disarmed door
