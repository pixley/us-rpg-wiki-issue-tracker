Late Oathday evening, aboard TAS Flinthawk
	Tetron and Alistair wrap up their flight training
	Dominic and Bhoja start chatting
	Hammocks have been strung up below deck for us
		Krug starts LoHing everyone
		We sleep
			It starts to get humid overnight
			Bestial screeches and clicks in the far distance
Fireday morning
	Light rain and mist
	Jessie approaches us
		The Flinthawk can't turn on a dime
		The ballistae can be used against drakes
			Does require broadside facing
		She asks us what sort of approach we'd like for the ship's movement
			Aggressive
			Defensive, shaking off
			Speed
		Tetron pitches aggressive to give the melee guys a chance
		Bhoja chimes in, saying that our presence may be enough to get them to approach
			Viola: I can get their attention
		Tetron: what is the dragons' MO?
			They can get the drop on us
			Okay, speed then
		Warning: if you fall off, you will die
			Tetron is going to prep Fly for the melee combatants
			She also has a scroll of Gentle Landing to give to one of us
				We agree: Alistair, just in case
	Capt Grantham approaches once Jessie is finished
		He points to the hoard on a map, then indicates the surrounding area
			Lots of dragons here
		Plan is to use whatever cloud cover we can get to approach
			Ship has no cloaking ability
			If we can, we'll try to make it to the hoard and strike there
				Not especially likely we'll make it there before we're seen
		Double-check that Tetron and Alistair are good to mount
			Yup
Flying onward
	Alistair takes watch in the crow's nest
		Shinbira will be ready to get him when combat starts
		Iris and Viola also keeping watch on the bow
	In the early afternoon, Alistair catches sight of something through his spyglass
		A few draconic shapes approaching, lower altitude than the ship
		EXCEPT it's an illusion
			But real ones approaching from the side
		He Messages the captain
			Captain immediately orders rapid descent
		We become level with a horned drake that had been in position to ram the underside of a ship, surprising it
