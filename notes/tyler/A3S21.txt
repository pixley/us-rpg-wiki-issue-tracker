				Ritual recall knowledge results:
					The ritual is charging magical energy
					Killing casters ends the ritual, of course
						3 rounds left due to acceleration attempt (not guaranteed to succeed)
					Can also cancel via removing the treasure being used as material components
						But the stuff is in chests...

	Sounds of celebration for the coming festivities for Day of the Inheritor
A few days pass
	We take it easy
	We report stuff to the government
	Zaknos decides to pull out a letter he's received mentions it to the rest of the party
		Red envelope
		Someone has heard of us
			They want to invite him and a plus-one to dinner
			He just has to twirl it in his fingers
		He and Nilbog twirl it and vanish
