Fireday evening, inside the Dragon Fen cave
	Tetron and Iris asks to take some time to heal up
		40 minutes
	Alistair looks around during the wait
		He makes it back down to the bottom of the mound
		He sees bones belonging to all kinds of creatures, not just draconic or humanoid
			Some very large too
		Semicircular marks carved into the ground in front of some wooden planks
			The planks appear to open to something within the mound
			He checks one for traps
				There's some kind of mucus covering the separation point
					Severe contact poison
			Alistair calls up to the rest of us
				Krug: Please wait
					Okay
		He starts going around burning the corrupted red ferns
			They smell like flesh when they burn
	Viola just keeps watch
	Tetron's reallocating spells
	The burning flesh smell prompts Tetron to consider the possibility that creatures were turned to plants
		Normally, transmutation stuff is concerned with flesh-to-stone and back
		He's not familiar with a particular spell, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility
		Tetron asks Alistair if he knows what he's burning
			Bad stuff.
	Viola begins to feel like we're not alone in this chamber
		She mentions the feeling to the others
			They're kind of dismissive about it
	Alistair gathers some bones that look to be in sellable condition
	Tetron inspects the well
		Murky water that goes deep into the earth
			Cannot even remotely see the bottom
			Not any worse-looking than other swamp water
		He feels a primal presence emanating from the well, similar to how Targane feels in the arcane
		Something is tainting this well of magic
	Krug finishes his healing stuff
	So what now?
		Alistair: I want to open the door!
		Tetron: We need to investigate the well.
			Iris: The door goes beneath the well
	We gather at the door
		Krug pulls it open
		The hole requires bending over for all except Alistair
		It's completely dark inside
			Alistair lights his wayfinder
			There's water within, and we can't see the bottom
				Small reflective bits are in the water
				The water is moving, despite all other bodies of water around being still
			Powerful chaotic energy emanates from the opening
				Iris observes its similarity to the Maelstrom
		Tetron: Okay, what do?
			Iris: Whatever spawned Isadore is down there; we need to eliminate it
			Alistair has drought powder
				Would get rid of a significant part of it
				But we do still have water breathing
					Iris: But what would exposing ourselves to it do?
						The water is controlled by something within
							Would the drought powder piss it off?
								YEET
	The water level drops very quickly
		The reflective stuff is the hoard
		Something scratched the fuck out of the walls, through its entire length
		Something within makes a very disturbed noise
			Primal screeching
INITIATIVE
	Round 1
		Tetron steps forward, then casts Howling Blizzard into the remaining water (creature saves)
			Area is difficult terrain now (the water has turned to slush)
			Also the slush makes the creature somewhat visible
		Alistair steps forward and fires an arrow into the shape (hit, miss)
		Viola tries to locate the creature's precise position (nope), starts singing to draw attention away from Alistair (success), then takes her dueling pose
		Iris tries to identify a weakness of the creature (none), then resistances (mental), then pulls and chugs a potion of quickness
		Krug walks up to the edge, bolsters his aura, then raises his shield
		The creature casts Prismatic Spray on all of us (all save except Viola, who benefits from Krug's Glimpse), then tries to smack Krug (miss)
			Enfeebled 2, 1 round
		We feel a rumble
	Round 2
		Tetron casts Howling Blizzard again (creature fails the save), then steps back
		Alistair stabs at the creature (crit, miss), then backs away
			Creature: persistent fire 1d10
			Creature: enfeebled 1, 1 round
			Creature: off-guard, 1 round
		Viola stabs with a finisher (hit), tumbles around (success), then takes her dueling pose
		Iris steps forward, intensifies the vulnerability, then stabs (hit, hit)
		Krug slashes with holy might (hit), raises his shield, then slashes again (miss)
			Creature: weakness 6 to Strikes, 1 round
		The creature casts a spell (Iris misses a responding stab; Iris and Viola crit save, Krug saves, Tetron and Alistair fail), then Iris hears in her mind "give back what was stolen from me"
			Then it dies from being on fire
After combat
	The water lurches, and then an awful purple ichor fills the water
	Alistair wants money, but he won't be able to see through the water
		He grabs as much as he can from dry land
	Krug and Iris swim to the other end
		There's a giant heart at the bottom
			It's pallid and no longer beating
			Iris thoroughly inspects it
				It's less of a creature and more a pure manifestation of the Maelstrom
				Something had to specifically make its way here from that plane
				Iris considers the relationship between her parents and the Bains
					It extends at least as far back as Iris can remember
				She feels a reclaiming feeling
				She places her non-prosthetic hand on it
					She feels like she could gain something here
						A glimpse or push deeper?
							Push 1 - success - Iris's self is muted as her perception expands, confusing and overwhelming
								What does she seek?
									Why is Iris the way she is?
										Stream of consciousness:
											a stagecoach, a throng of people surrounding it (some run over)
											roiling chaos of an unfamiliar city on fire
											stagecoach door opens and a few figures quickly shuffle in
											Ravana's arm is covered in some dark liquid
											she tries to remove it but can't
											she looks at Eligor
											he asks whether it was a success
											it was
							Push 2 - fail
				As Iris's organic hand is pushed away, she stabs the shit out of the heart with her prosthetic
		And a shitton of treasure down here too
		Krug tries to determine a source for the red ferns
			It's denser here than anywhere else, but it's not a singular connected organism or anything
		Krug notices the change in the water and goes to check on Iris
			He sees her stabbing repeatedly
			He tries to get her attention
			She looks back, clearly frustrated, shakes her head, and returns to the surface
	Both emerge from the water
		Krug asks what Iris was doing and whether she's okay
			Iris: I'll be fine
		Iris reports that all the treasure is down there
			Tetron: No plug?
				Nope
		So, we'll have to go down and gather treasure by hand
			It'll take time
		Results
			210 cp
			1769 sp
			4891 gp
			93 pp
			Combined: 6000 gp
			Potions:
				Drakeheart Mutagen - 11
				Blight Breath - 12
				Dragon Bile - 15
				Greater Elixir of Life x3 - 13
				Purple Worm Venom x2 - 13
			Took about 45 minutes
	Viola: How do we exit?
		???
	Alistair: We should investigate the well
		Tetron gives it a proper analysis
			It is possible to gain power from it
			This is a place of power for primal magic
			Drinking of this water would grant boons, but it has been corrupted by the creature below, so it is mutagenic
			Unfortunately, Tetron isn't especially knowledgeable about the Maelstrom
			There MIGHT be a way to ready oneself or purify the water
			Tetron shares all this with the rest of us
				Krug has an idea: Since the Maelstrom is pure chaos, the magic would need to be removed/unraveled, but it would be difficult, especially from an arcane perspective
			Tetron takes this into consideration, places his hands at the surface of the water
				Putrid tendrils begin to coalesce near his hands
				After a moment, he finishes and flings the gunk aside
			He uses one of his magic sugar cubes, then drinks from the well
				Nothing appears to have happened to him physically
			Alistair proproses bottling it and reselling it
				Eaugh
				He fills a waterskin with it anyway
	Iris huffs off in disgust and looks for a way out
		If someone could make it up there and swim against the current, and we could go out the way we came in
		There are small pockets where climbable vines are growing down, but Krug can't fit
		We can send Iris with a rope to throw back down through the terlet
			And that's what we do
Back on the surface
	Tetron picks up the thurimble
	Alistair burns more red ferns on the way back
	We make it back to where we were dropped off
		Iris shoots off the flare
Late night, TAS Flinkhawk
	Grantham alone at the helm
	Sleepy time
Overnight
	Tetron does not mutate, but he gains a partial boost to INT for the next week
	Tetron pulled into Targane's liminal space inside the Zenith Staff
		Targane looks bored
		He berates Tetron about the primordial soup
		He insists that Tetron be more grateful to him
			Tetron's insipid choices don't serve himself or the party
			He recognizes that his offer has been thrown back in his face
			Tetron is being shortsighted
		Tetron: Do you know why I drank the juice?
			Because it's worth it if it assists the others
			Unlike YOU
			Power is nothing if it is not applied
				Targane: We agree, but serving these useless buffoons is without benefit
		Targane: The others aren't working toward your goal
		Tetron: What were you before you were a wizard?
			Targane: Never not pursuing that
			And that's why you're wrong
				Like ants working together to build the colony
				It's tactical folly to not go that route
		Targane: The making of a great wizard is that they need not rely on anyone
			He goes off on how dumb and bad the others are
		Targane conjures images of Tetron casting support spells, esp Haste
			There's an opportunity cost to boosting the others
			You could be granting yourself these boons
			Nothing else is important
				Not family
				Not partner
				NOTHING
			You have to go all-in to pursue your goals
				Tetron: Sure, but what is the difference between a wizard and a magical monster?
					The others are better than me in other regards
					I can make a difference.  My grandfather made a difference because he was inspired by you.  My father made a difference.
		Tetron: So can I go to bed now?
		Targane's expression shifts to sheer bitterness
			We need not speak here again
			Now that I've received your unequivocal response, I'll let you know: I will be endeavoring to take what is mine
			You will be locked out of this staff
			Good luck with your found family BS
			He still intends to take Tetron's body
	All of us sleep dreamlessly
		It has been some time since any of us had any dream, save Iris
Starday late morning
	Alistair asks Tetron about the swamp juice
		Basically no effect
	Viola has a plate put in front of her
		Jessie offers to feed Viola
		Viola protests, she's not mentally disabled
	Pancakes for breakfast!
	Iris opens conversation
		Does anyone else feel like the Bain's connection to the Malestrom, the Bain's connection to the Kaulfields, and Iris's biology are a coincidence?
		Viola: Is your mom not your mom?
			No, stupid
		Iris: I think I might have been some kind of experiment
		Viola: But if it was deliberate, why did your parents hate you?
			I didn't come out strong
	Alistair goes to look for more pancakes
		But he stumbles when the ship lurches when engaging its turbo
		He does get more pancakes
	Viola: Tetron, you were about to say something?
		Maybe, still deciding, but I want more pancakes first
			Dominic volunteers to refill since they wanted more too
		Tetron eventally shares his conversation with Targane
			Alistair: Ditch the staff?
				No, it's a family heirloom
			Pointed toward the Jagged Saw about it
			Viola: Can we at least find some way to reassert Tetron if we notice that Targane has taken the wheel?
				Maybe?
	Iris goes above deck to see how the flight is going
		Jessie reports that the captain requested expedited return to Cassomir
			We're apparently in a most-hands-on-deck situation
			Someone important to the city is compromised, and we're heading back to aid
				Iris offers the Radiant Dawn's services
	Tetron gets to work on some scrolls to pass time
		Iris requests Tailwind
			Get a wand
			Iris can't use wands
		He does Darkvision instead
	Alistair goes above deck and looks out across the landscape
		There are a few scattered villages on the edges of the fen
	Krug sits and prays
		He feels off today
Mid-afternoon
	Alistair can see Cassomir in the distance
		And the ship begins to descend
	The ship docks in a large arcane cradle-like structure
		No one greets us
	Jessie escorts us off
		She believes that our aid was instrumental in the operation's success
		She offers aid in the future
	Announcement: TAS Flinthawk crew summoned for debrief
	Dominic has been taken for treatment
		Tetron goes to ask if Viola could get the same treatment
			Jessie gives her endorsement
		Viola is led away
	So the others are just left unattended in Greyguard Castle
		Wait on Viola or report back to Hosetter?
			Should also check on Pierce for Viola
			And wait for her
	Viola led below
		Into a medical ward
		Dominic treated first
	It's taking a while for Viola to return
		Should we follow?
		They have no idea where to go
		A soldier approaches
			They explain that Viola got hit with Never Mind and they're looking for her
			Another soldier escorts them
		They find Viola and Dominic on cots
			The nurses there are talking, clearly stressed
				They notice the party
				They explain that the caster was very powerful, so they haven't had success
				Iris volunteers if they have a scroll (since Tetron can't cast it)
					NOPE
			They offer to hold Viola here while they wait for another caster to become available
				Iris: How long?
					20 minutes if the first try works, but could be much longer
				Tetron: Alternatives?
					Temple of Abadar for coin
					Maybe Hosetter?
					Private mage?
					Alistair: Could also check in with the Heartwood
					Reminder: Coimbitore the Generous is also an option
				Tetron: Could get some housekeeping done while we wait for Viola
					Could sell stuff in Almas
				Iris is not interested in leaving Cassomir
				Krug, Tetron, and Alistair head out
					They have to be escorted
			The other healer comes by
				NOPE
Port to Almas
	Selling!!!
		Except incense and thurimble need a special buyer
			Alistair's expertise needed here
				Seeking Beltracci
					NOPE
			Perhaps an academic?
				There was someone who would be into that, but it was Prof Mollick, and he gone
			Might be better to try to sell it in Taldor...
