Combat in the water cave continues
	Round Five
		Nilbog waits for Krug or Alistair to get into better position
		Alistair attacks the more injured of the two creatures surrounding him, killing it, then swims back towards the outcropping with Nilbog on it
		Creature 2 lashes out at Viola and Alistair, hitting both of them, but her wild third hit is riposted by Viola, which is lethal
		Nilbog pumps a fat heal into Alistair and casts shield
		Zaknos fires four shots at the sleeping ape, missing all four times
		Tetron puts up an illusory scene between him and the big boy to hide himself and Nilbog and then puts up his shield
		The last remaining creature moves up to Alistair, then lashes out at him and Krug, missing Alistair but critting Krug
		Krug swims up to the last creature, takes his shield in both hands, and misses a shield bash
		The ape remains asleep
		Viola swims over to the outcropping, starts to climb, then takes a parrying pose while on the wall
	Round six
		Alistair cuts at the last creature thrice, hitting twice, and killing it
		Nilbog heals Krug and casts shield
		Zaknos stows his weapons and starts to climb onto that one ledge
		Tetron delays
		Krug swims over to the outcropping and climbs it
		The sounds of combat wake the ape, which picks Viola up by the head, jumps into the water, and swims away with her
		Tetron shoots a lightning bolt into the water, hurting Viola more than the ape, then moves closer
		Viola wriggles out from the ape's grasp and swims to the surface
	Round seven
		Alistair starts swimming out towards Viola
		Nilbog carefully repositions on top of the outcropping
		Zaknos finishes his climb up to his outcropping
		Krug leaps back into the water and starts swimming toward Viola
		The ape surfaces, bites Viola, critting her into unconsciousness, and then bites her again
		Tetron shoots an acid arrow at the big boi, hitting and applying persistent acid damage
		Viola is less dying
	Round eight
		Alistair swims up to the ape and stabs it
		Nilbog casts fireball directly above the ape, but it dodges some of the flames
		Zaknos shoots four times, but only hits once
		Krug swims towards the ape, then bashes it with his shield
		The ape swipes at Krug and Alistair, hitting both (Krug glimpses Alistair to prevent the damage), then slashes once more ineffectually, then persistent damage ends
		Tetron casts acid arrow, but it misses, so he tries to cause a distraction but fails
		Viola is less dying
	Round nine
		Alistair fails to feint, misses a hit, then swims to provide Krug with a better flanking position
		Nilbog casts fireball again, same result, then fails to hide on the rock
		Zaknos moves and sets up a rope for folks to climb up after him
		Krug wades over the Viola, uses lay on hands on Viola (reviving her), then bashes the ape
		The ape swipes at Krug and Viola (glimpse for Viola), slashes at Krug again
		Tetron uses metamagic to use telekinetic projectile against the ape
		Viola feints twice, failing both times, then attacks it anyway
	Round ten
		Alistair takes the flanking opportunity to get a killing blow
It's over!
	Kiruka and Valin swim over
	Nilbog shaken by the fact that he couldn't quite keep up with all the damage
		Relic gift - No More Mistakes
	Zaknos relocates the rope to the harpy's outcropping and tries to negotiate
		Harpy mentions that there's one other creature on the level
			They don't eat the same food as the harpies - they eat metal
				BLACK PUDDING FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
				They're over at the far end of the cave
		She wants us to leave
	Alistair tries to go into the cavern that the ape emerged from
		Viola warns him against it
	We ask to chill on her outcropping to heal up
		Krug has to tow Nilbog along
	Zaknos asks if the harpy has seen any boats
		She doesn't even know what that is
			Viola explains it as a nest that floats
	Tetron recommends that the harpy go talk to her sisters
		He tells her that the others don't ever want to see us again, so we can't exactly go talk to them for her
			This seems to convince her
	Nilbog starts to heal people
		Can't help Viola and Krug
		Success on Tetron and Alistair
		Success on Nilbog and Zaknos
Alistair explores the ape's cave
	Swims past the now-open stick gate
	Cavern with partially-eaten humans
		Scattered limbs, potentially severed for specific feeding
		They might have stuff on them, but Alistair would have to dive for it
			One of the skeletons is wearing armor, and it looks like there are rings one floor next to it
			Another has some kind of bracelet
			A third robed one is holding a flat wooden disk and has a horn strapped to them
		Is anything dangerous around?
			Looks devoid of anything else
		Alistair gets all the jewelry and brings it to Tetron for ID
		He then drops off all his equipment to then be able to lift the armor
Magic ID
	Rings are abjuration and evocation
		Abj - Unknown, though it is a beautiful ring with a sapphire
		Evo - Rose-gold ring with an orange skull, a ring of minor arcana
			Grants the following cantrips: mage hand, detect magic, and prestidigitation
			Viola takes it
	Horn is conjuration
		It's a ram's horn, and it continues to have water on it.  It can be activated by blowing into it
	Bead bracelet is necromantic
		Unknown
		Viola suggests maybe Nilbog should try to ID it
			These prayer beads might be used by evil creatures
			They don't have any deity-specific iconography, at least not as far as he can tell
	Disk is transmutation
		A staff that can grow and shrink
		To Zaknos
	Armor is non-magical
		It's well-wrought, but he's not sure why it hasn't gotten eaten by the black puddings
		In Krug's hands, it almost feels a little chillier than his normal armor
			He swaps it on, his old armor going into Tetron's bag of holding
	Nilbog breaks the bracelet, and beads scatter everywhere
		Tetron objects
Viola asks Valin what the deal between Marcellus and Tessra is
	Back when their group formed, the group (esp Marcellus) wanted to do good for people, not just work for pay
		They passed up a lot of good-paying or reputation-boosting opportunities
		They went around Andoren, Taldor, and the River Kingdoms and helped the problems of poor folk
			Missing livestock or persons
			Usually in exchange for food or shelter
		Valin was content with that life, journeying with his best friend
		For a time, there was a centaur problem in the Verduran, which was disrupting the people who lived there
		They teamed up with a leshy, Chantarelle, and took care of the problem, satisfying the people
		Looking back, though, it seems like it wasn't all good
			The Lumber Consortium was driving expansion into the forest, which they didn't know
			Centaurs retaliated enough to where the group had to drive them away
			But the local Kellids had gotten involved, some of the Consortium folks had died
			Some shrine of the Kellids' was apparently destroyed, and that got them really riled up against the group, even though they weren't involved, at least as far as Valin knows
		Not sure why they're targeting Marcellus specifically; the whole group was responsible
Getting ready to move on
	There's a barrier in the way with a human-sized hole in the bottom and a gap up top
		It seems like dead bodies are shoved through the hole for disposal
		Viola asks Tetron to throw a lit rock through the hole
			We can only see cave floor
		Alistair can bend down to see better through the hole
			Sludge on the ceiling
			And he can hear a second one
	Viola knows about black puddings, though she hasn't fought one before
		Mindless
		Immune to crits, piercing, precision, acid, mental, slashing, unconscious, visual
	Plan to get past the puddings
		Use loose copper to draw them out via mage hand
		Nilbog contributes his bucket hat to provide more of a lure
			Can jingle out copper
		With the help of telekinetic projectile and spout, IT FUCKING WORKS!!!
Upstairs!
	Unlit man-made mine
		Tetron has the light
	We move forward towards some tracks
	Alistair smells more dead people and can hear a growling noise
		Peering around the corner: it's just a dead end
	We approach the beginning of the track at a two-fork split, and the growling approaches from the fork the track goes down
		Tetron nixes the light, and the humans grab onto Krug and Nilbog
	Krug and Nilbog can see three big wolves approaching, similar to the ones from Falcon's Hollow
		Except they seem to have a stronger bond with the vines, as they're using them to feel around
	Krug and Nilbog help us split up into flanking positions
	TIME FOR COMBAT!!!
Surprise!
	Nilbog explodes a fireball
	Humans wait for Tetron to turn on the light
	Tetron casts light on a rock on the ground and golfs it into the intersection
	Alistair moves up and shanks the lead wolf twice
	Nilbog casts fire ray against the middle wolf and shields
	Viola walks up to the middle one, feints, and finishes it
	Zaknos shoots at the lead wolf four times and misses all of them
	Krug moves to flank the lead wolf with Alistair, takes his shield in two hands, and bashes it to death
The roof caves in above Krug, Viola and Alistair!
