Sunday, late morning
Tent'lund
	Viola is still talking to Boring
	With everyone else
		Viola has just run off
		Krug is trying to catch up
		Alistair keeps looking for goblins
		Zaknos finishes asking around
		Krug catches up with Viola at a field outside Tent'lund
			Viola is sitting on a stump, Boring hasn't approached, but she hasn't noticed the others approaching
			Viola gestures at him to head back and that she's got it
			Zaknos catches up to Krug
				Krug pulls him aside to keep him away
		Alistair scans the various thoroughfares and such looking for a tent large enough to contain pigs or goblin paraphernalia
			He hadn't heard the info that Zaknos got
			Tent'lund is labrynthine, and he patrols desire paths he finds
			He does find enough goblin-esque tents spread out to where it's not a super useful distinguishing feature
			He does eventually smell the scent of roasting pig
				He finds a pit roast
			He checks the area
				He sees a wheelbarrow
					Folks around here wouldn't be able to afford a wagon
				It's a cluster of ten or so smaller tents
					Some are ramshackle
					Arranged in a semi-circle
					Definitely tents sized for small ancestries
				There are ten or so goblins around
				Are there signs of human belongings or potential burial sites
					Some stuff here is obviously newer than others
						Including the central tent
						Other stuff is grimy
					He doesn't see any evidence of humans
				Lack of evidence - moving on
	Viola asks Boring for her story
		Boring isn't comfortable sharing with someone she barely knows
		Viola offers to share her story instead to help her be more comfortable
		Afterward, Boring gives her account
			She says that she aspires to be nothing; not friends with anyone, not enemies with anyone, not important
			Came from Isarn, Galt
			Lots of bad energy there and people with weird limbs
			Preacher who's really bad has a posse
			She left for a smaller village [NAME?]
				People there would turn into creatures of flesh and bone
		Viola asks if the preacher is Jericho
			Boring supposes so, but folks just call him the vicar
			Viola explains that he's a major part of the group the party is looking for
		Boring starts to get agitated with all the questions, demanding only two more
			Has she been directly attacked?  No.
			Why does she not want friends?
				She has seen the results of sharing info
				Some of her friends tried to escape, but they were sold out and killed
				She left on her own, telling no one, leaving everything behind
	Viola reconvienes with the others
		Explains that she's going to arrange passage for Boring
		Not much new info about the Aegis Coalition
		Have time to help with the goblin search
	We find Alistair
		Just around the place that Zaknos was pointed to
		Plan of approach:
			Zaknos can speak Goblin, so they might be more amenable to him (Viola's idea)
			Krug goes along with Zaknos
			Alistair will use the distraction to sneak around to search through their shit
			Viola finds an excuse to not look like she's loitering
				She finds a group, including a smallish orc, playing Go Fish
	Zaknos enters
		He remembers that Goblin society tends to have elders as leaders of sorts
		He starts to walk past one of the tents, he's stopped by one of the goblins, saying that he should avoid the entrance to one of the tents
		Dude asks what Zaknos wants with his clan
			Zaknos responds in Goblin, complimenting the setup and that he can tell that the clan has a strong leader
			Dude is the leader: Joknok (Clan's name is Grig)
			Dude mentions that one of the other tents is where to get the meat
			Joknok warns him about a repeater crossbow trap and to watch his step around
			Krug mentions that he wants to try something: could he ask if they have special meat?
				They have cooked pork, fresh pork, and whole pigs
				Zaknos says he's looking for the real nasty shit
					They have that in the main tent
					Joknok gestures for the trap to be disarmed and then invites Krug and Zaknos in
					As they enter, Joknok points out a whole bunch of locations where they shouldn't touch
					Joknok pulls back a screen to reveal cuts of meat
						Haunches (where the branding would go) and heads are missing
						"We've got premium cuts", delivered just the other day
							How recent?  "Quite fresh."  He licks off blood.
								Zaknos also tastes the blood.
						Krug looks for brands
							None at all
							He asks about those
								Joknok says that, as leader, the butts are for him
									Sense motive!  He's lying.
		Meanwhile, with Alistair
			He hears a rattling sound and a squeak from one of the tents
				"Shut up!"
			He makes his way over
		Viola is dealt in
			2 cp wager
		Back in the tent
			Zaknos asks if they could pay "generously" for the good stuff
			It's being roasted right now
			Zaknos says that he enjoys watching it go
			Dude removes the butt from the pit and unwraps it
				It has the brand
				Wraps it back up
			Zaknos says that now he knows where to find the good stuff, so he'll come back
				As long as the whoever makes contact speaks Goblin, they can make a deal
				They don't expect to have more stock in any time soon
				Note: None of the pork sold comes with the blood
		Alistair inspects the tent
			Vague shifting sounds of someone on metal, grunts of pain or frustration
			Someone else beats iron bars
			He can hear similar noises coming from an adjacent tent
		Zaknos and Krug leave the tent
			Zaknos explains what Joknok told him
			They saw the mark
			Zaknos was trying to urge them to get more in for evidence
			Krug suggests that they do buy something
				Zaknos asks aloud where he could get some sandwiches
					Another goblin comes out and says that they don't sell, and that they were closing up
		Alistair takes advantage of the distraction to peek into the tent
			He sees a dude sitting on the ground facing away from him
				Dude is missing most of his clothes, and is shivering
				He turns around, acknowledges Alistair, and says nothing
		Zaknos asks what else they can get?
			Goblin says that they can get lost
			Krug loudly asks what they're doing with stolen pork
