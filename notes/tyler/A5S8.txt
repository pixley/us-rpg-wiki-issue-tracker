Cassomir, after midnight, Sunday
	Alistair staking out Cheliff's apartment
		Looks like all occupants have finally fallen asleep
		He crosses over to the roof of the apartment building
		He uses his Insistant Door Knocker to create a magical passage through the roof into the building
	He finds himself in the living room
		A dog-sized lizard-like man in a robe is sleeping on the couch
		He looks around the room
			He finds some papers weirdly stuffed into a side table drawer
				He takes a subtle peek
					One mentions the Orthodox Exaltists and a list of materials
				He carefully opens the drawer and retrieves it
					There's also keys and a bowl made of mother-of-pearl
						He leaves them alone
		He then moves over to the door to the office
			He checks the door for traps: none
	Into the office
		There's a lion statuette atop a stack of books atop a chest
		He looks around the room before stepping in, suspicious that the door wasn't trapped
			Nothing suspicious other than the lion
		He approaches the lion
			It's magic
			He attempts to disarm it: nope
				But he notices that there's a weight trigger at the bottom
					He realizes he could slide his dagger under that trigger to keep it from activating when lifted
				There's a latch on the underside
					Opening it reveals a small rolled piece of parchment
						List of names and dates
							Looks to be a list of clandestine meetings
								Some of these look to be infernal agents
			He considers the books the lion was atop
				Nothing within the books really stands out to him, other than some rhetoric
					So nothing particularly incriminating
			And there's the chest
				No traps, but locked
					He picks it
					Open!
				A full set of armor
				Weapons with runes
				Small tube with stoppers on either side
					Weighty with gold filigree
					He takes that without looking at it for the moment
				He takes the armor and weapons as well
		Now for the desk
			A book with blatant fascist rhetoric
				With a "property of Cheliff" written in it
			A few diaries, covering the past several years
				He takes them without reading them
			A rolled-up map
				It's of Taldor
				Various locations (with no obvious reason) marked
				He takes it
			No drawers in the desk
		Bookshelf
			Various books on academic topics
		He looks around the bed
			He finds a memory box
				Wedding vows inside
					Detail something about 14 Neth 4709
					In both Common and Tien
					He leaves those alone
	Back out to the living room
		The lizard guy is still asleep
		He goes to the next door
			It's the kitchen
	Kitchen
		Nothing incriminating, but it is stocked with insects in addition to regular food
		He takes a quick look before moving on
			In a dark corner, he finds a small pack secured to the underside of a table
				Within, there is a copy of the keyring, but mundane
					Unfortunately, it's not visually identical to the magic keys, so he can't swap them
					He takes it anyway
	Next door is the bathroom
		Feels like someone was in here recently
			Warm humid air, embers in the fireplace, fresh laundry
		More searching...
			Looks like some paper was thrown in the fire recently
				He uses the poker to pull the remnants of the papers over to him
					For Tetron
	Back to the living room
		Alistair looks at the lizard guy for pockets
			He has a cravat
				Save that for last
		He approaches the bedroom
			It has a doggy door
				He pokes his head through
					He can see the wife laid up
				He squeezes through
	In the bedroom
		Docs on the nightstand
		Vanity also has items of interest
		And there's a bookcase
		He looks for traps
			Nope, but the vanity has an unordinary space behind the mirror
				It looks like something could be pressed on the mirror frame...
					He considers it, but the only thing that seems like it could be relevant is the note in the charm
						It's half of something...
		A briefcase atop the bookcase
			Contains Aegis Coalition info
		He goes out to get the other keys to get the other half of the thing
			It's a Tien poem
			It indicates the moon design on the mirror
			Behind the mirror is a dossier packet, including a personal letter from High Strategos Pythareus
				He takes the packet
	Back out to the living room
		He pickpockets the lizard guy
			It's a cockroach - blek
		He uses his door knocker to leave
			But he hears a scratchy voice near him
				It says his name...
				But he can't see where it came from
				"You are known to me now.  Don't run."
				He gets the fuck out of dodge
	Out in the streets
		The voice slightly fades as he flees the area
		He activates the darkness in his cloak
		He's not being physically pursued
		He makes it back to the Black Pit Tavern
	In the tavern
		Krug is awake when Alistair enters the room
			He's been concerned about Tetron
				Tetron's been sleeping listlessly, with feverish sweating and groans of pain
			Alistair reports what happened
				Krug figures it can wait, pending Tetron's condition
					Borgon chimes in, saying that it's quite the disease
			Krug hopes that it wasn't the swamp water
		The sound of breaking or popping bone emits from Tetron
			This is what woke Krug up initially
			Alistair asks if they should take him to a cleric
			Taranis asks whether he should wake Tetron up
			Another crack is followed by Tetron yelping
			Alistair mentions what Gourdon said about the water
			Should we wake the others?
				Yes
		Viola and Iris join the discussion
			After a while, a massive tearing sound
				Tetron's pants have ripped apart, revealing a mottled brown mass
			Iris considers what the primordial energy could be
				Deffo the swamp juice
				Could be temporary... could be permanent
			Tetron's right foot is hardening
			Alistair volunteers to go find a druid
				Cur's Tooth is his backup plan
			Tetron's lower half continues to grow
	At Cur's Tooth
		Alistair heads toward Tarik the Unclean's place
			After a while, a bleary elf with a damaged face answers the door
			He explains the emergency and his need for a druid (or other primal caster)
			Dude suggests Coimbitore
	To the Bellflower HQ
		There's someone already awake
		Alistair explains the emergency
			The gnome goes to get someone
		Ten minutes later, an old tiefling comes out
			"I heard someone's looking for a druid"
			Alistair explains again
			She agrees to follow him
	Back at the Black Pit
		A wet bloody mass of hair is emerging from the bottom end of the mass
		Tetron looks uncharactistically vulnerable
		Krug is LoHing to keep Tetron from sustaining grevious injuries
		Alistair and the druid appear
			She berates us for allowing him to drink the water
		The druid inspects Tetron
			He's doing better than she'd expect of someone of his stature
			She declares that he's turning into a centaur
			She asks how much he drank
				A cupped hands amount
		She instructs us to pull on the weird nubs growing out of Tetron
			And don't stop even when Tetron screams
			She shoves a potion in Tetron's mouth as we start pulling
				It knocks him out
		She consults her book and declares that Tetron'll be a centaur for the next week
		We continue to work on keeping Tetron's body from tearing itself apart
Morning, Sunday, Black Pit Tavern
	By 8 AM, Tetron's transformation has seemingly completed
		He a big boy now
	The druid suggests that we rest
		Don't strain Tetron today
		Or the day when he turns back
			Luckily, it won't hurt as bad
		She asks for payment: 400 gp
			Iris takes it out of Tetron's coinpurse
		She turns to Iris and mentions that the Bellflowers are still waiting on more info on Iris's folks
			Iris is about to bring up what she's learned lately, but the druid doesn't have it in her to discuss it right now
	Tetron wakes up
		He screams in terror
		Krug claps his face, telling him that it's going to be okay
	Okay, so now what?
		We can't exactly go about operations today, since Tetron's indesposed and we're all tired as shit
		Iris still wants to go do prep for the auction stuff
			Which doesn't really involve the rest of us, per her reckoning
		Viola: Well, shouldn't we debrief Alistair first?
			Oh yeah!
	Debrief
		Alistair starts pulling out the stuff
		Okay, how to deliver?
			Disguise?
			Viola: Why disguise?  This is relevant to our specific investigation
			Coimbitore?
		We start pouring over the materials
			Tetron casts Ghost of Lost Works on the burnt paper
				It ties Cheliff to several extrajudicial imprisonments
			Iris dips
			Points of interest
				Third elder fey escaped into the city
				Pierce's transfer directly implicated
				Goods stored at one or more of the map-marked locations
				We copy the marks to the Pellsieve
					None of them correspond to any known specific location
			Viola berates Alistair for taking the Tian armor and weapons
		After much debate, we finally decide to take the evidence to Buracir first
Hosetter with Viola and Alistair, mid-morning
	We ask for Buracir, but she's unavailable until 10
	So now what?
		Dunno
The Roaring Hall with Iris, mid-morning
	This is where Sloane's place is
	It's already busy
	Iris has to weave through a whole bunch of stalls to a stairwell
		She goes up
	Iris knocks on the door
		Sloane wasn't expecting Iris so soon
			She had just gotten out of the bath
		Iris asks to speak about the auction
			Sloane advises that her room isn't soundproof
				Iris says that our room wouldn't work, on account of Tetron being half-horse
					wut
		Sloane lets Iris in, locking the door behind them
			Sloane was partway through breakfast
			"This isn't related to Tetron being a horse, no?"
				Unrelated
			Iris gives the rundown on what she's learned and asks what Sloane knows
				She's run the auction before
				One person parties only
				She knows what she's selling, but not necessarily others' wares, and definitely not the attendee list
			Iris's plan is to attack her parents while her grandmother is at the auction
				Sloane advises that she won't be available to fight if the fight is during the auction
					She's participating in someone else's stead
			More details on the auction
				Sloane pulls out a roll of parchment
				Gaultier Tinbeard is the presiding auctioneer; the sonsignor is Keenta Tzipora
				Sloane is selling weapons in place of Yardley Mogglewog
				Auction is at 1 PM; doors close at 12:50, and no entry or exit until the auction concludes
				The fey would be either part of the "prestigious stock slave" or "heritage pieces" lot
			Sloane recommends that one of us who can either read people or object values well participate
				There's gonna be crazy shit
				The bid ettiquite here is much more subtle than normal auctions
					Helpful in determining who won which item
					Which will be important in seeing whether Iris's grandmother does get the time fey
			Iris figures that her plan of attacking during the auction may not work after all
				Given how high-profile Iris's parents are (especially in the wake of the Bain incident), they wouldn't be able to go themselves
					Which is why her grandmother is involved now, since they wouldn't trust a servant with something this valuable
			Sloane is bummed that her participation in the auction would preclude her from fighting
				Yardley is paying for her room in exchange for the service, so she owes him for this
			Is there another option?
				...
				Sloane suddenly turns her head to the door, stands, and creeps over
					Iris listens
					There's a man with a scratchy warbly voice speaking so a deep-and-clacky-voiced man
						"I shall have you know, I am under oath to not give the location of any lots before the auction begins" -warbly
						"I understand it's not your policy... I was simply asking if it was in the city or an extradimensional plane." -deep
						"I don't have the authority- [pause] It's in an extradimensional space." -warbly
						Once the deep-voiced man leaves, the warbly-voiced man worries out loud before walking off
					Sloane: Looks like someone got something out of Gaultier...
						She pokes her head out, sees Gaultier's door close, then goes back in
				Sloane: If one of you wants into the auction, tell me by the end of today
					As soon as the ballroom doors seal at 12:50, I won't be able to help you
				Sloane: So what are you thinking?
					Iris thinks it would be good for her to be at the auction, but she doesn't think she can swing it...
					Could they even use the fey?  The orb it's in is really heavy
					Iris: How are goods moved out of the auction hall at the end?
						Any number of means: extradimensional containers, teleportation, flight, etc
						The higher value the item, the less likely the buyer is to stick around
				Sloane: By the way, given how passionate Viola is about anti-slavery, probably don't send her
					Iris: Yeah...
						Krug probably feels the same way
						Alistair is 12
						And Tetron is both half-horse and a known Taldan noble
						So has to be my
				Sloane: How soon after they get the fey do you believe your parents'll stick around
					Probably leave ASAP
				Iris: So, we could do it tonight, but we'd be facing all three at once
					Sloane: Given that they might use the time fey, it might be worth the risk
					Iris: And then we can just use whatever money they had allocated to buy the fey ourselves
				So then we need to locate the planar palace...
					The key doesn't give an indication
					But... Iris is able to identify that having the key makes the door visible to the holder
						Also, even though planar palaces come with ethereal servants, her parents always travel with some actual servants
							And the door would be answered by one of the real servants if awake
							But she has the key; she might be able to convince an ethereal servant
								Though all of us rolling up would be sus anyway
				Iris figures that it's time to consult the rest of us
					Do you have a Sending scroll?  Makes it faster to inform rather than walking all the way back
						She offers the full 150 gp for it, but Sloane only takes 100 gp
					She messages Viola; asks her to fill in the others and Patia
				Iris asks to stay with Sloane to recuperate
					Sure
					She also takes the opportunity to buy some scrolls since she's already at the Roaring Hall
Hosetter, mid-morning
	Buracir is finally available to see us
		She looks well
		We hear the tail end of the previous conversation
			Chester still hasn't been located
		Viola informs Buracir that we got the evidence, and we'd like guidance on how to gracefully present this to the Taldans
		Buracir quickly clears her desk to receive the info
		We spend like half an hour pouring over everything
		She's clearly shaken by the extent of Cheliff's treachery
		We discuss way forward
			Best to leverage Buracir's position to get a meeting with Kasaba
			She gives us a note to pass along to the Admiralty Citadel
		Someone comes in to inform Buracir of something
			Viola: Concerning Chester Zenza?
				Yes, Maj. Zenza received a box containing Chester's tag and a bit of pelt, decorated with Chelaxian red velvet
					WHICH IS WHAT IRIS SAW LAST NIGHT
				Viola: We'll mess the Kaulfields up good
	Viola pops in to inform Patia about the operation
	Back to the room
Roaring Hall, evening
	Iris resting while Sloane is out
	She wakes up to find Sloane reading something by lamplight
		Sloane notices Iris rousing immediately
	Sloane asks Iris about her joining the Radiant Dawn
		It's Iris's first group
	Sloane mentions that she's been thinking about what to do next
		Join an adventuring group?  Not sure if that's her sort of thing
		Sloane muses that she has business in Oppara with her half-brother
			Iris: Yeah, we're going there next too
				But she doesn't actually know the specific reason beyond "fuck with the Aegis Coalition"
	Iris does daily prep
Black Pit Tavern, evening
	We all convene
	Tetron pulls Sloane aside and asks her if she could help him move better by riding him
		You'd need to figure out some alternative to a bit and bridle
		Tetron whips up a rope harness around his shoulders
