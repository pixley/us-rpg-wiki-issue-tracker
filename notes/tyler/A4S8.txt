Battle continues
	Round 2
		Tetron moves as he casts cone of cold, with two bandits taking the full force
		Iris stands up (provoking an AoO from the big guy on the way up, miss), intensifies vulnerability, then retaliates with a successful strike
			Dude claims that it barely hurts
		Alistair shoots the guy farthest from the party (hit then miss), then tries and fails to hide
		Big guy pulls a flask (provoking AoO from Iris, hit) and chugs it, but it doesn't seem to have any combat effect, then tries to heave one of the barriers at us (Iris fails, Krug succeeds)
			That AoO did hurt him, apparently
		Krug rages, strikes the big guy, then raises his shield
		Viola steps to set up a flank with Iris and Krug, feints past big guy's defenses, then delivers a blow
		Bandit next to Iris attacks twice (hit and miss), then frightens Iris
		Distant bandit loads an alchemical bolt into his crossbow and fires it at Tetron, critting, then grabs another piece of ammunition
		Bandit close to Alistair expresses concern that fighting a party with a child would be really bad, then fires at Krug, missing
	Round 3
		Tetron moves toward Alistair, then casts heal on himself with his staff of healing
		Iris intensifies vulnerability, then attacks twice (hit then miss)
		Alistair fires twice at distant bandit (two hits), killing him, then hides
		Big guy goes to chug another flask, but Iris's AoO interrupts him with death
		Krug moves to flank the bandit with Iris, then misses an attack, then raises his shield
		Viola tumbles past the bandit, grazes him with a finisher, then takes a defensive pose
		Bandit among Iris, Krug, and Viola attacks Viola twice (hit then miss), then tries to rally the other remaining bandit, Leonid
			Tetron recognizes Leonid's name: Zaknos's brother; he calls out the mutual friendship
		Leonid asks the other bandit to lay down his arms
Battle over
	Leonid approaches Tetron
		Hasn't seen Zaknos since their parents split
			How is he?
		Tetron says that he knows exactly where Zaknos is
			But due to the current circumstances, can't exactly trust things
		Leonid explains his situation
			Was a guard in Galt, but got kicked out for being crap at it (despite being mind controlled)
			He joined up with Urumir the Scorned because he was the first strong person he came across
			He apologizes for stealing from Mosely
				First taste of power in a long time
		Tetron: Is anyone from Galt following?  Would Zaknos be in danger?
			No more than anyone else is chased for trying to leave Galt, but left alone after crossing the border
	Iris asks what Kien's deal is
		They've been together for a few weeks
	Alistair helps Mosely up
		Complaining about his wares being broken
		Iris says that Kien's life is up to Mosely
			He demands death
			Kien says that he can help escort Leonid
				But this is kind of BS
			Viola suggests that this could be handled better
				Lots of arguing
					Including Mosely suggesting force-feeding dude infinite baked beans
				Some lying on Kien's part, but Viola calls him out
				Eventually offers to be a turnip farmer
	Tetron summons Chimpy
		Get Leonid to Zaknos and Kien to Nilbog
		Chimpy appeals to Kien
			"As a former aspiring piece of shit myself..."
			Kien is on board
		Tetron asks if Zaknos could come out here
			Chimpy is cool with that
		More arguing
			Eventually, throw Kien in the pit to keep him still until Zaknos arrives
	Sales pitch from Mosely
		Lip balm that helps persuasion
			Viola wants it
			Tetron asks if it could be a gift for saving him
				Sure
		An item that is either an ethereal oar or a rock that excretes ether
			Krug buys it
		He wants help with a new item
			We need to capture lightning in a bottle
			The jar is huge
		Tetron asks if he has any rations
			Yes, but it's formulated for ratfolk
				It's oats and stuff, though, so it's fine
			Tetron and Iris buy some
	Tetron is curious about how Mosely was carrying the jar
		He made a special modification to his bag of holding
			He offers to sell it to us, but it's grody
			Instead, Tetron tries to get a look in an attempt to start a reverse engineering
				Mosely notices and offers to sell him the secret (and the needle tool) instead
	Mosely asks for reviews for the items we bought last time
		Krug doesn't remember the time during which he was wearing the boots
		Viola reports the birthday surprise not working so well
	Loot from the camp
		Some healing pots
			Iris chugs them
		Octopus potion
			Tetron takes it
		Levitate but better potion
			Tetron takes it
		Urumir has a coin purse with 34 gold in it
			And several cigars
		Other dead bandit has some concealed knives
Back to camp
	Iris and Krug notice that Kadiha and Margot have weird expressions
		It looks like they were arguing
		Margot's holding a feather but tucks it away when the party arrives
			The feather looks like it belongs to Taranis
				Krug informs Tetron
		Can Margot do something with the feather?
			Some spells require something from the target creature
	Tetron immediately confronts them
		Kadiha greets him as though nothing's wrong
		Margot mouths something to Tetron
			He can't read lips, so he messages Margot to ask what's up
				Margot says that we should stay back, as Kadiha is dangerous
		Tetron reports what happened with the bandits
		Kadiha offers to take first watch
			Krug volunteers to watch with her
		Tetron messages Margot as to when and where to talk
			It needs to be when Kadhia is actually asleep, not just pretending
	First watch
		Krug keeps watch and also pays attention to Kadiha
		Krug makes conversation
			Kadiha mostly stays in the city, but she's glad to be back in nature
				She's Kellid
				Was taken to the city
				Krug: Whereabouts?
					Verduran Forest
		Kadiha asks about how we met
			Falcon's Hollow around the time of "all that chaos"
			She acknowledges Kellid involvement at the time
			Krug brings up Teedum and Kreed
				She knows the names, but she has no personal experience with them
	Iris has a vivid dream
		She stirs in her sleep
		17 playing cards swirl about her
			She grabs out at one
				It's an old man leaning on a stick, face down
				She hears the faint sound of a chariot rolling away
	Second watch
		Alistair and Iris
		Iris considers her dream
			She has a vision of a group drawing cards, with 17 cards remaining
				Laughter, voices that she doesn't recognize
			The card she drew, The Hermit, represents isolation and withdrawal when reversed
		Distant sound of approaching flapping
			Taranis arrives
				Carrying a piece of parchment
					It's a letter from the guy
						He apologizes that the doll disappeared, which means the curse got passed
	Third watch
		Tetron and Viola
			Tetron asked Viola to come along for the conversation with Margot
		Before he goes to bed, Alistair sneaks up to Kadiha and determines that she isn't asleep yet
		Tetron checks on Taranis
			Looks fine
		CORRECTION - Spelled Khadija
		Tetron messages Viola to tell her about Khadija's potential duplicity
		Timpani notices that the eye of Iris's rapier is open
			It thrums with power
			Tetron realizes that it's probably due to this being a day of power for Arazni
				It also thrums in time with Iris's movements
					Might be dream stuff
				Probably better to leave it
		When to talk to Margot
			Alistair isn't up to check Khadija
			We can see her from here, but unsure
			Tetron messages Margot to wake her and ask whether 
	Convo with Margot
		She found Taranis's feather on Khadija
			She suspects that Khadija is trying to gather as much info as possible on us
		Khadija has been assigned to her for multiple years
			This has made her job difficult
			Her options have become very limited
		Viola: what's Khadija's background?
			Kellid from Taldor
			Came into family's service as an adult
		Tetron asks how he can even trust her, given that he sees her as an enemy of his homeland
			Margot claims to not be against Taldor
			Has much more interest in fringe groups than the actual Taldan gov't
				More of an anti-corruption thing
			Where does she fall in regard to Eutropia?
				Publicly, her family was neutral
				Privately, her family supported the loyalists
				She prefers Eutropia
			Tetron presents his Lotheed insignia and tells her that he also has a background in intelligence
				She produces a brooch of House Baylen
					They're based in Cassomir, but they have other connections
					She's marrying into that family
					Tetron recognizes the house: they live in the same area that Tetron's mother is from
						They rose to power by playing both sides
							Switched sides from loyalist to rebel when the tides turned
						Head: Countess Zandriel
							Her son: Viscount Arando
								Big braggart
								Thinks himself politically savvy
								Kind of a kiss-ass
				Margot says that Arando as her husband will be great for her job
					He hears a lot and he's a blabber-mouth
		Tetron: How does Khadija sleep so little?
			She doesn't know
		How to approach confronting?
			Viola would like to not attack her in case she's innocent
			Margot: Also problematic due to Khadija sending correspondence back to Almas
		Viola: Does Khadija know you took it from her?
			Yes
			She chided Khadija for picking up random feathers off the ground; it's unsanitary
		Tetron burns the feather
		All done
Wealday morning
	Iris wakes up feeling like Arazni accomplished something
	Tetron messages Iris to ask about the eye on her hand
		She tells him about her dream and the accomplishment thing
		Tetron fills Iris in about Khadija
	Have to keep up deniability
	Around midday, Alistair notices an alcove with candles in it
		It's a roadside shrine
		Viola recognizes it as one to Alseta
			She asks to stop
			She has Timpani take a look
				She scurries around and reports that the magic here is good, which is a good sign
Wealday night
	Watches:
		Iris and Khadija, Tetron and Krug, Viola and Alistair
	Second watch
		Tetron asks Krug about the Khadija situation
			Tetron walks him through Margot's issues
			Krug tells him what Khadija told him about her background
			Could the 'K' in "K Ego AS" stand for "Khadija"?
				If the 'S' in "S Ego AF" stands for "Sloane", then probably
			Krug: How much do you trust Margot's word?
				Tetron: Viola felt good about it
			Krug: Could we even get any info out of Khadija?
				Could get into her things
			Tetron mentions his idea to fake a confrontation against Margot
			Krug wants to give Khadija the opportunity to come clean before attacking
				Tetron: Might have to attack first, but definitely not kill before gathering info
				Krug suggests confronting Khadija about the feather
					Tetron: Can't implicate Margot
						Can't blow her cover
	Third watch
		Viola fills Alistair in
			He volunteers to rifle through her shit
			But she's in the wagon tonight, so no dice right now
Oathday
	Completely uneventful
	Looks like it should rain soon
Fireday
	Coming up upon Giant's Teeth
	Sounds of wildlife have started to pick up
	We arrive at a pass
	Travel slowed somewhat by rain
	Tetron messages around to call a team meeting at third watch
		One of us will (the person who takes watch with Khadija) not get a full night's sleep
	Khadija hears something
		Sound of wolves, perhaps dozens of packs
		"How amazing to watch them hunt"
		Krug: Do you think they'll bother us?
			No, unless something were to bring them directly
			They know better
		She mentions that there's a legend about the area
			Krug has no idea
			Site of a great battle long ago
			Said to be haunted by the spirits of the large creatures involved in that battle
	Khadija asks Krug why we travel with a child
		He has a lot of desire to adventure
		Lots of promise
		Very capable and valued by the group
		Not a burden at all
		She looks him over
			Asks how old he is
				Krug doesn't know
				Why does she care?
					Looks to be about the age when young Kellids prove themselves in the wilds
						Krug: Have you done that?
							No
							One of the few traditions that she respects
			She considers him less of a child and more of a capable fighter
		Krug compliments her reverence for nature
			It does what it wishes, regardless of what mortals put upon it
			She sees value in those who do what they must on account of their nature
				This reminds Krug of Amos's philosophy
					Krug mentions this
						Krug catches flashes of surprise, recognition, and determination
						But she only says "hm, interesting"
						Krug asks if she knows him
							She does
								Has done business with the Maceras on occassion
								Krug: Small world
	Krug: I feel like there's something more to this trip than you're letting on
		You don't seem like someone who would just be a handmaiden for a dignitary
			Khadija: I work for who pays me
				Krug: Who?
					Khadija: The Maceras, of course
		Krug: It seems like you didn't need us to begin with
			The more protection the better
			Also, wasn't her call
			Simply tasked with personally seeing to Margot
		So this is just a job for you
			Yes, for the past few years
			Can't complain
		Do you take jobs that take you round these parts
			Used to be a merchant's aid
				Interfaced with Amos a few times
					Doesn't see eye-to-eye with him on some important stuff
						Krug: 
					Brought together through mutual connections
					She finds it difficult to work with someone who places family above things that she considers to be more important
						Krug: the greater good?
							Something like that
							The idea that this place, these people, exists unnaturally
								The sooner that mortals return to living naturally, the better
									Krug: very Kellid of you
										Surprised that whoever took her from her birthplace allowed her to learn that sort of stuff
										Khadija: what do you know about nature?
											She draws something in the dirt at her feet
												It's a diagram of the planes
												She points to the planes where the gods live
													Natural things: air, water, food growing
													But other things, like Viola's drive to perform are also natural
													What's unnatural: Our ability as mortals to choose
														For a long time, there were prophecies that guided our lives
														This died with Aroden
														Humanity is suffering under the yoke of being the sole navigators of their faith
														Krug: Do you think that was influenced by your own lack of choice in life?
															Perhaps, but it's more that the planes are out-of-balance
														Krug: Choice is empowering
															Khadija: Choice is scary

Next time: party chats during third watch
