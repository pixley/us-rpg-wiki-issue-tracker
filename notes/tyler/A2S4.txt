Starday: Afternoon
------------------
Alistair shows up back at Agrimony Point
	Guards still taking notes
	Sebastian hamming up his injury
	Alistair listens in stealthily (successful)
	Alistair does pick up Sebastian's name
	Also overhears Blackstrand
Picking up with discussion about journal; still at Amos's
	We decide to go to straight to the police
We arrive at the guardhouse
	Yates wasn't there at first, having gone to respond to the Agrimony Point incident
	Once Yates arrives, he takes Tetron to one interview room and Zaknos and Nilbog to another
	He also wants the writ, which Alistair has
	Zaknos and Nilbog start speaking Goblin, pissing off Yates
	Tetron tells everything about what happened, including *charm* and *sleep*
		And acknowledges that he did know that enchantment spells are illegal
		Tetron's case is escalated to chief of guard
		He has to stay at the guardhouse in the interim, still has to wear the manacles (he gets them padded)
	Back with Zaknos and Nilbog
		A goblin guard (Groll) enters, had to get called all the way from Copperdown
		"Don't bullshit me so we can go home."
		Nilbog finally gets his towel
		"Please don't make me call in the *zone of truth* folks"
		"If you keep stalling, we're going to have to press more charges"
		They chat about having made a bunch of noise and accidentally scaring people
		They're about to be let go when Zaknos finally speaks Common
	After interview, Yates asks where Alistair is
Meanwhile, Alistair at Agrimony Point
	He pokes around inside after the main body of guards leaves the premises
	Guards in Sebastian's room
	Alistair heads to guardhouse
	Can't really get at anything outside
	Posts to see if he can recognize anyone entering and leaving
Still waiting for Alistair
	Viola volunteers to go find him with a guard detail
	Alistair reveals himself as soon as Viola steps outside
	Alistair is brought into an interview room
	Gets caught out on a claim that he was going to meet Felix, but slips through saying that he cased the place from the outside
All of us are called in to chat with the chief of guard (named Tamma Barnes)
	Brawny auburn-haired halfling
	We owe 230 gp over the next 9 months; Tetron paid the full 23 of the first payment
Back to Vistrum's
	He's impatient to see the evidence
	We convince him to go to the guard
	Vistrum is basically catatonic, but we talk him into getting help
Party turns in for the night, Viola gets bath
Alistair scopes out richer area of town (the Slopes)
	Not as nice as the nice areas in Almas
	Security is older and less effective
	Doesn't do anything of note
Next morning
	Viola picks up her stuff, chats about having been inspired by the Flying Heron's old master
	Off to LAP!
LAP Briefing
	Small room
	Pair of middle-aged men (Eli: elf in navy-blue robes, and Gage: 5-o'clock shadowed half-elf with wispy arm)
	No extra consumables, penalty of ban
	Revival: 1 revive per encounter
	18x18 flat terrain, 3 options, pick once for whole trial
		1) No cover
		2) Natural (vegetation, no debris)
		3) Debris (vegetation, broken palisades) - OUR CHOICE
	We're allowed to break stuff
	Gage and Eli would be proctors for provisional mission
Trial 1
	First one is a basic aptitude test
	3 spear automatons
	We best them quickly, with only Zaknos taking damage
Trial 2
	2 medium-size creatures that look like faries that do spinny sonicy stuff
	A third joins late
	We win, no one getting downed
