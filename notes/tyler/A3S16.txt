Wealday afternoon, beaches near Claes
	INITIATIVE!
		Round 1
			Viola tries to Bon Mot the father and son, crit failing and failing, respectively, then takes a defensive pose
			Father tells Viola to take a walk, casting Suggestion, and Viola's failed Bon Mot distracts her from being able to resist.  He then turns to Tetron and asks to have a more civil discussion.
			Nilbog catches up with the rest of us
			Zaknos delays.
			Cyrus surveys the situation, steps out of a bush, and says that, as students of an esteemed academy, that letting something happen to the turtle would be a bad look.  Father responds that he understands, but claims to have done us a service by having taken care of the bandits.
			The son delays.
			Tetron tries to back up Cyrus, saying that them sending Viola away does potentially expose that they were here and the events here could bite the two in the ass.
			Nilus, posted above Alistair, readies his weapon.
			Krug presses the ID point, threatening to expose them if any harm were to come to the turtle.
			Namira readies her weapon.
			Alistair activates his Ventriloquist's Ring to throw his voice further back in the jungle, prentending to be backup.
		Round 2
			Viola casually starts to walk away.
			The father calls us meddlesome, but we do make a good point.  He offers to leave the turtle be, but they want half of the eggs.
				Tetron and Alistair notice that his delivery (both voice and posture) is somehow reptilian...
			Nilbog requests 51%, then, when that isn't even acknowledged, he adds that, given how many of us there are, the fair split would give a shitton more eggs to our side.
				The father laughs and accepts the 51%.
				We look back toward Cyrus and friends, and they don't look *that* happy about the deal, but they seem to be going along.
		Combat averted for now.
	Tense walk back to the beach
		Nilbog covers himself in seaweed again.
		The Bains take position next to Tetron and Krug in the brush.
		Quiet conversation with the Bains
			The Baron last saw Tetron when he was "the tiniest thing"
				How has he found himself in a foreign country among "this riffraff"
					The war changed everything
					And killed his father
					The Bains took Eutropia's side
						Their station has risen, giving them more time for scientific pursuits
			Why are the Bains all the way out here?
				Most of Tetron's family's dealings with the Bains were with Lady Bain.
					The Baron and his son prefer to be with their books and don't want to be among randos
				The turtle is integral to his son's research
					The father is along to help, considering his son an extension of himself
					Tetron asks Lord Bain directly what he researches
						The son finally speaks: He can disclose the barest details, since Tetron is a family friend.
							He aims to better his own body, finding the turtle's powers of manipulating creation useful for his efforts
							The Baron gives his son a look to get him to stop talking
	Viola snaps out of it
		She is pissed and shrieks Bain's name and "how dare you", sprinting back
		The Baron tells Tetron to stop her
		Tetron messages Viola, telling her to not scare the turtle and that they reached an agreement
			Viola is mad about being mind controlled
			Tetron insists that she stand down and waves her over
			She sheaths her sword and hunkers down with them
	Tetron resumes conversation with Lord Bain
		Is this their final destination?
			They're heading back home once this is over
		Tetron reads the room
		Tetron asks about how they fucked up the bandit so bad
			Baron Bain jumps in
				Just as mortal families have legacies, other energies have some kind of influence on mortals
					Tetron tries to figure what the hell that even means
						He's referring to something passed down through blood, but it's pretty oblique, and they look like ordinary humans (other than the mannerisms)
						A larger reptilian creature passing down its bloodline isn't possible
	We wait an hour and a half
		It's sunset now
		A shape starts to emerge from the sea: it's the turtle
			It's large and dark green with large spines on its shell
			Also on its shell are patches of things...
				Little ferns, algae, plants, creatures
				Not normal for growth on a sea creature
				Looks like the turtle overflows with life energy
		It beaches and begins to dig out a hole into the sand
			While it digs, more creatures emerge from the shell
		Baron talks under his breath
			"Very good, an older specimen"
			Starts taking notes on a clipboard
		The turtle lays eggs for hours
		Tetron considers the consequences in Opparan society for double-crossing neighbors
			It takes generations for families to weave together for reliance; marrying into each other, stuff like that
			It wouldn't be the end of the world, but his mom's ancestral home is next door
				So, unless his mom's family never interacted with them, there are ties, but Tetron wouldn't necessarily know
	Three hours later
		The turtle slides back into the water, leaving a nest of tons of eggs behind
		The Baron looks slightly irritated, but neither of the Bains make a move against it
		One the turtle is out of perception range, the Baron says that we should proceed
			He lights up the area for us
		Tetron asks if they have the proper means to transport the eggs
			The Baron says that they do
		Tetron's friends bring the wagon over
			Eggs and sand loaded, takes a couple of hours
		The Bains don't look like they're planning on digging
		Nilbog analyzes the eggs to try to pick out the better ones for us and leave the worse ones for them
			Doesn't do much
		Nilbog also takes an extra slice of the pie, and no one else notices
		Baron inspects our setup, then has his son check the pit
			He's satisfied
			"It was wonderful doing business with you."
			He mentions that Tetron would know where to find them if we were to find ourselves in Cassomir.
		Namira says that it's probably time to get a move on
			She suggests that we get the hell out, maybe even go to Claes where it's safe
			Viola checks how far we are from Claes
				Like an hour
	As the rest of us leave, Alistair uses his cloak to better hide himself to watch what the Bains do with the eggs
		It takes a while for the Bains to do much of anything after the wagon leaves
			They don't even speak
		Ten minutes pass before the Baron asks his son whether we're satisfactorily far
			Yes
		"Gather up only the unbroken eggs"
		The son puts them into his bag of holding
		Baron: "I tire so of dealing with these insects."
			Son says that he was itching for a fight
			Baron berates his son for his demeanor and giving away too much info to Tetron
		The son drops his human appearance, revealing a swole dragon-like biped
		The Baron invites the son aboard his back, then turns into a green dragon
		Then they fly away, low over the water
	Alistair leaves to catch up
We make it to Claes
	A guard hails us
		"It's like three in the morning!"
		Namira responds, giving UofA credentials
		Guard comes over and checks our cargo
	We're let in
	Alistair arrives right after we're let in
	Namira sighs and finally unclenches her jaw
		She got really bad vibes from the Bains
			Viola expresses that she wanted to put a stop to them
		Namira: It shouldn't be a detriment to the study that we only got half
	Alistair sneaks in and approaches us
		Namira is startled
			Viola and Tetron: He does that
		Alistair reports what he saw
			Nilus is confused about the acid thing, since green dragons don't breathe acid
				Maybe the son?
		Alistair works with Namira to do a reconstructive sketch of the son
			They do a decent job
			Tetron takes the drawing after they're done
	Bedtime!
We sleep in until mid-morning Oathday
	Gray skies, mist
	We head back over to the science camp to deliver the eggs for teleportation
Heading back to Almas
	Tetron asks Cyrus what his next plans are
		Get the project wrapped up
		His plans have changed, with funding having been challenging
		Might have to take a trip, other studies to gain station in academia
		Tetron offers to send along anything we learn about notable creatures we come across in our adventures
	We approach the site where we last saw Zae and Ennis, around late afternoon
		Nilus asks whether they should get involved
			He's super nervous
				Claims he's not confident with religious pagentry
			Krug says that they can wait, it's cool
				Viola chimes in that we don't even know what we're doing
		The place is overgrown and covered in butterfly weeds, as those with some natural knowledge identify them
		We see Zae, with ceremonial dress, and she runs over to greet us
			Perfect timing!
			At dusk, the ceremony will begin
			She starts to explain, with the caveat that she knows almost nothing about it
				Every year, Iomedeans looking to prove themselves and the companions they have gathered
				She was told to have their prayer cushions set up, and nothing is allowed to break their concentration
					"A test of will"
				At the end, a cleric will come out and present some kind of "cool fire"
				She's excited
				Ennis chimes in that religious folks would be best
					Zae says that the participants just need to believe in the good of others
						Tetron bows out, and Cyrus follows his lead
		Ennis approaches the onlookers
			Welcome to watch, but caution against interfering
			Not sure what effect it would have on the ritual
Evening of the ceremony
	Ennis sets up his mat outside, while Zae sets hers up on the interior
	Zae: Don't come in until I say so
		It's dark in there
	They both start audibly praying
	Strangely, it had been growing darker, but now it's not
		We start to realize over the next few minutes that some of the plants around have begun to glow
		Namira, from afar, is furiously taking notes
	Zae calls us in
		She says that she thinks we're supposed to do some stuff, but she has her eyes closed
		Inside the cave, some glowly crystals, a large circular thing mounted to the wall, and some steps that go up and straight into a solid wall
	Viola lights a torch and takes a look at the circular object
		It's wooden and worn, has stars and a moon on it
		As this happens, we all hear some echoing screeches from the distant meadows
			Dozens of audio sources
			And then it sounds like the things approach
		Viola suggests that someone who knows something about religion to interface with it while the others see what is going on outside
			Nilbog volunteers
	Nilbog takes a look
		He tries to think of what this is
			Celestial patterns are common for religions, but that isn't necessarily directly connected to Iomedae
		He walks over to and up the stairs, trying to see if the wall is illusory, but it's solid and he bonks
			He licks the wall, and it tastes like normal rock
			He knocks, and it sounds solid
	Viola emerges to see Ennis in prayer and glowing eyes in the underbrush
	The prayers of Zae and Ennis grow louder, and Nilbog hears a clicking noise behind him
		He sees that the circle thing has changed
		Criscrossing bands of color and colored stones have appeared
		Inside the gems, some kind of signs that can only just be made out
			Each is different, but he'd have to take a close look
		Zaknos comes in to help Nilbog
			They analyze it and consider how it'd move
			Krug advises that they not touch it on account of the ceremony going on
	Outside, three creatures emerge from the undergrowth
		Viola and Alistair move to engage
	Inside, Nilbog looks at the gems
		A key (12:00)
		Unknown (1:00)
		Spiral (2:00)
		A leaf (3:00)
		A butterfly or moth (4:00)
		Unknown (5:00)
		Downward-facing bow (6:00)
		Unknown (7:00)
		Unknown (8:00)
		Grotesque horned creature (9:00)
		A face split in half with different expressions on each side (10:00)
		Unknown (11:00)
	Creatures begin to appear inside the cave too through burrowed tunnels
	Zaknos says that maybe they need to interact with it for the ceremony
		The gems on the outside and the big star look like they can be pressed
	Outside, Alistair switches to casting Spout to deal AOE damage
		This frees Viola to defend inside
		Krug plays backup
	Zaknos suggests that they help with the creatures and pick up the circle thing later
		Before he heads off, Zaknos presses the gem at the 2 o'clock position, but it pops back out
	We continue fighting for a few minutes
		Alistair suggests that maybe we need to address something in the cave to make it stop
			Zaknos waves him over
		Zaknos grabs hold of the large star and rotates it
			It clicks as he turns it, but when he lets go it returns to its original position
		Zaknos attempts to pull on and twist the gem without any marks around it, but it doesn't do anything
		Krug tests the large star and discovers that it only goes 31 clicks and doesn't twist down past its origin point
		Nilbog tries to determine whether it's a magic thing or a mechanical thing.
			It's mainly mechanical, with magic used for the visualization.
		Krug presses on both marked teal gems at the same time, but no effect
		Zaknos continues trying the twisting and bopping of the gems
		Zaknos looks for the gem icons elsewhere in the room
			Nope
			But there are carved reliefs at the stairs
				A firey sword, which is Iomedae's symbol
		Krug suggests that maybe it's like a calendar
			The symbols are like the gods, there are 12 of them, the months are named for the gods, and the order does line up
		Zaknos considers the nature of the metallic markings
			10 cp to 1 sp
		After further debate, they figure out the add connected to unconnected of the same color
			19 is the missing number
			Alistair suggests pressing the gems that add up to 19
		Nilbog and Krug consider Iomedean holidays...
			19 Rova is the Day of the Inheritor
		Krug gets it!
			Ratchet to 19th click and press the Rovagug/Rova gem
			The light-filled space gets so bright that we are blinded
				And Tetron sees this from afar
			The monsters are gone
		We hear a voice demanding that a single pure-of-heart champion enter
			The wall at the stairs vanishes, revealing a bright light
			We discuss who would be suitable
				Nilbog suggests Alistair
				Viola counter-suggests Krug or Nilbog
		We hear more skittering approaching
		Nilbog heads for the stairs
			Nilbog vanishes into the light
			Zaknos is worried
	Onslaught
		It's tougher than the previous wave
		Tetron can see the light of the meadow start to flicker
Nilbog finds himself in a vast sea of light and fire
	His very essence burns
		It's not the comforting warmth of forgiveness of Sarenrae
		It's the burning of fervor and sacrifice
		He struggles to maintain his breath
		He hears, both in his mind and echoing everywhere
			"Would-be champion and savior, state your name!"
				He answers "Nilbog... Nilbog... Nilbog."
				There's silence after
		The voice states that he finds himself at the precipice of a great Iomedean blessing, but his purity and intentions shall be measured
			If he doesn't believe in his goodness and his ability, he may not survive
			He is asked if he wants to enter "the sea"
				He responds that he thinks there's someone more deserving
Back on the material plane
	It's been an hour, and we're exhausted
		Except Tetron
	A localized flash of bright light happens near us as Nilbog is ejected from the door
		"May the champion of light enter and be judged."
		Nilbog goes to consult with the rest of us.
			He explains what happened.
			Viola is all like "need someone with confidence, cool" and sprints toward the door
				Krug calls out, saying that it might be dangerous
				Viola's cool with that
Viola finds herself in a vast sea of light and fire
	It burns really bad
	Battling crashing waves of emotion
		Like how she felt when she first saw Sabrina Pierce, but she's in danger of being consumed
	Voice booms out, asking for ID
		Viola Ballestra, improvisational swordswoman, fighting to help the common folk
	Is Viola ready for a test of might, will, and purity?
		Sure, not sure what purity is supposed to entail
	Viola is pulled up and encounters some kind of creature that she can't make sense of
		Thousands of eyes, rings, gears
		It says it will distill the most pure of her essence
		It draws her toward it, and she's pulled head-first into its body
		Shattering of ego, every inch of her is peered and judged, everything is revealed
It's been two hours
	Zae has a nose-bleed
	The bush-light continues to flicker
No time at all has passed for Viola
	Viola's soul is turned inside out
	The fervor echoes
	Her soul makes the tiniest noise, and then it rings out over and over, louder and louder
	The fervor and drive to perform is there
At the third hour
	A light emerges from the wall as the door reappears
	Viola emerges, holding a massively bright torch
		The dinging can be heard behind her
	Door closes behind her
	Torch is inlaid with gold and diamond, it's blinding
	Tetron sees the brightest freaking light emanating from the cave
	Zae and Ennis collapse, barely conscious
	Zae verifies that we did what we were supposed to do and then passes out
	Viola doesn't know how to turn off the torch
	Krug scoops up Alistair and Zae and carries them off
	Do we camp here?
	Krug asks Ennis if Viola is the only one who can handle the torch
		No one's ever handed it off
		Should we go straight back?
			Not necessarily.
		Krug suggests that Tetron might be able to help, since he's been resting
	Namira wakes Tetron up
		We argue about what to do
		We eventually decide to take shifts driving the cart back while Viola stays up holding the torch
Fireday Dawn at the gates of Almas
	Viola, Zae, and Ennis are whisked to the Iomedaen temple
		Old-ass priest is happy to see the torch
			Dude asks who should get credit
				Viola tries to frame it as a praise of Sarenrae, but dude interprets that as her trying to anonymize
				Viola responds with her actual name, and dude insists on appending Sarenrae affiliation to that
		Viola has received a moderate boon of Iomedae
		Viola feels super awkward about the whole thing
	Viola realizes that she has performances for the whole weekend, so no sleep
	Varuk drops by to take folks to the Cerulean Keep for the interrogation, so no sleep
