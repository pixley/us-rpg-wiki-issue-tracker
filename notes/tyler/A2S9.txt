In the underpass
	As Gregory (the wolfkin thug) falls, Viola receives a branding of sorts on her chest
	She hears "father" in Gregory's voice; she thinks it's a curse
	Nilbog can't stop it, but he can reduce the swelling
	Viola tells Zaknos and Nilbog to go on ahead
	Viola calls for guards, they start interrogating her
At the market
	As Alistair continues to track the cart, Krug and Tetron secure the unconscious thug (Jeremy)
		They manacle him
At the docks
	Both carts begin to approach the docks
	No workers visible
	Several figures standing around
	Suspiciously quiet
	Alistair begins to sneak around toward the dock building, while trying to keep pace with the cart
		He gets noticed by one of the people
	Tetron asks Zaknos where Viola is
		He talks about the curse
		"She'll be right behind us."
		Nilbog looks troubled
	Alistair pops potion of invisbility and makes a break for the dockhouse
		One of the thugs notices Alistair missing
		Alistair throws his grapple up to the loft; it makes a noise, and the guy notices, but he can't see where the noise came from
	Tetron makes Krug invisible, and that group of four approaches
		Krug takes true lead, Tetron takes visible lead
	Remora, the mage from before, a hunched black-haired woman, and a pretend foreman
	Zaknos claims being lost, the thugs don't buy it
	Roll initiative!
		Krug recognizes Appleslayer, a white dog, that is barking to keep the carts at bay
			It has taken crossbow shots from Remora's gang
		Alistair shanks the fuck out of the mage, he slumps out the window, his staff clatters to the ground
			Woman out front is dude's brother, apparently
		Alistair jumps out the window
		Tetron casts lightning bolt against two of them
		Nilbog casts fireball against woman and Remora, but they both crit save
			The building gets burnt
		Krug smacks woman with his shield really hard, then raises it
			Woman smells like a dog
		Remora chugs a healing pot and tries to demoralize Tetron
			"Even if you kill us all, you'll never stop us"
			It doesn't work
		Woman snarls and tries to bite Krug
			Hits, Krug has to Fort save
				He fails, but doesn't know the effect
			She grabs him and flails him
		Zaknos runs over to Appleslayer and carts and tries to warn the cart drivers
			The carts start to turn away
		Dude on the pier draws his weapon and enters the ship
	Top of the round
		Alistair makes a running jump down to the pier and sees the "foreman"
			Screams coming from the interior
		Tetron hastes Krug and pulls back
		Nilbog casts fireball again with the same targets, both fail the save
			The dead mage's body is starting to catch fire
		Krug takes everstand stance, then starts bashing the woman with the shield, hitting once
			Puss starts coming out of Krug's arm
		Remora runs up to Nilbog and tries to stab him, hitting him twice (one crit)
		Bitey woman howls and fails to bite Krug
		Zaknos pulls his bow, marks the bitey woman as prey, and then fires at her
			BOOM HEADSHOT, and her body gets pinned to a beam
			Second shot goes toward Remora, but Nilbog has to dodge the errant shot
		Viola arrives, screaming about the curse when you kill them
	Top of the round
		Alistair makes it into the ship
			Dudes tied up, one guy dead, a red haired woman trying to treat a person who has lost their leg, the "foreman" has a machete
			THERE'S A BOMB ON THE SHIP
			Alistair attacks the "foreman", second hits
		Tetron recasts lightning bolt against Remora
			She dodges
			He gets into flanking position with Nilbog
		Nilbog backs off and casts sound burst
			Remora takes half-damage
		Krug flanks Remora and shield bashes, then raises his shield
		Remora attacks Tetron, hitting and critting once each
			Krug uses glimpse of redemption against the crit
				She takes the enfeebled
		Zaknos warns Viola about the last guy and starts to move past Remora, thinking that the others have her taken care of
		Crazy guy attempts to disarm Alistair, loosening his grip
			Further attempts to disarm fail
		Viola approaches Remora, fails to feint, fails to strike
			Remora mentions that she should retrieve the mage
	Top of the round
		Alistair attacks the crazy guy again, felling him
			Red-haired woman tries to surrender; she claims to just be here to get supplies
		Tetron magic missiles Remora
		Nilbog heals Tetron, then starts to head for the boat
			He spits on her on the way by
		Krug knocks Remora out
	Krug runs into the building to retrieve the mage's body
	Zaknos and Viola run to the boat
	Viola discovers the chest and takes out her key
	Nilbog goes to aid Krug in the burning building
	Tetron goes toward the ship
	Krug charges into the building and shoves the mage off the roof, then pulls the bitey woman free

Keyslots
	Left: Give me guidance
	Center: Cog in the machine
	Right: Flip paw father
	Six letter slots above each slot
	Scrambled letters available to the slots
Alistair checks the chest for traps
	It looks like picking it blindly would set something off
	Even with that knowledge, it seems like it'd be pretty hard
Alistair picks the lock on the chains, then removes the hinges, revealing a box within (the box is connected to the external mechanism)
Alistair inspects the key, it has text on it that he cannot read
Viola drags amputee to Nilbog, who treats them
Searching the bodies:
	Bitey: Beckoning Cat Amulet
	Mage: Potion of swimming(Tetron), belt of good health (Zaknos), blue key, spellbook and staff (Tetron)
	Remora: +1 striking composite shortbow (Zaknos), +1 rapier(Tetron), lesser potion of darkvision(Zaknos), bottle of holy water(Nilbog), +1 leather armor(Krug), boots of elven kind (halfling size)(Viola), yellow key
	Total money: 150 gp
Tetron recall knowledge: either the chest is filled with shrapnel and the bomb is small, or the whole chest is the bomb, and it takes out the whole dock
	"I don't think we can move this bomb far enough fast enough"
RAZAAN is the name on the key, and Tetron can read Infernal
Yellow key has a chiseled slot
Blue key goes with "give me guidance"
Alistair opens the thing (Tetron has to help by adding a prestidigitated cog to the yellow key)

Keren, the red-haired woman, finds Krug outside; she's an old friend of his and the owner of the dog
	Krug asks about Enris(sp?) and Zey(sp?)
	All three got visions
		Keren summoned to Lastwall to deal with threat of Whispering Tyrant
		Enris and Zey told to stay in Almas
Nilbog notices the dog
	Krug introduces Appleslayer and tells Nilbog that he's a friend
Keren Rynn(sp?)
	Tetron recognizes the surname: her father? was an old leader of the Knights of Lastwall
Helja arrives and is upset
	Viola introduces the party, claims they were investigating Remora, and barely is able to explain the situation in a satisfactory manner
Remora did the hit for the competing blacksmith in exchange for a brooch
		Blacksmith was jealous of Redkiln's quality of work
		Blacksmith "came into" a brooch from someone working for a Taldan person
		Brooch intended for sale to a merchant via an intermediary
			Meeting was supposed to take place tomorrow night in some alley in the Fleet District
Guards show up to investigate the scene
	We get things sorted with them
	Good word put in for Remora
	Remora had an active bounty out on her
Keren tells Krug that the armor is mostly for soldiers, but the rest is going to Lastwall
	She also advises him to help their other friends if he sees them
	There's something of an exodus from Andoran for the cause
	Helja is going too
Helja is appreciative
	Is there anything we need?
	She invites us to come by tomorrow morning.
	She takes Krug's shield to work on it
We head to guard HQ
	The concussed guy has since gotten away
