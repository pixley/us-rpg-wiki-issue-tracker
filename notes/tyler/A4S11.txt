Moonday afternoon
	Back at the cart with Tetron
		Tetron watches the rest of us head to the cave
		Just him and Margot (and the drivers, but they aren't real people)
		After a few minutes, he hears the clopping of hooves
			Coming from the same direction we did
			Single cart
				Ornate styling
			Moves along at a decent clip
			Driven by an older woman, pale and gaunt
			As it gets closer to Tetron and the carts, the woman turns back to say something to her cart's occupants, and then she slows a bit for passing safety
			Note: this is the third other traveler we've seen on this path all trip
			The woman notices that there's more to our caravan than the number of people currently there
				She asks whether there's trouble ahead
				Tetron says we're investigating the birds
				Tetron asks where she's headed
					Cassomir
					Merchant?  No, private carriage
			As the cart passes
				Tetron notices the interior curtain crack, but can't tell anything about the interior
				However, he notices the witness marking of a crest having been removed from the cart's exterior
					The coloration of the cart indicates not aligned with Andoran
						Probably further west (Cheliax or Nidal)
				Tetron realizes that they must have gotten past the cyclops corpse
					Messages the driver, requesting that she turn back
						The driver dismounts and walks back toward Tetron
					He asks whether they encountered an "obstruction"
						Yeah, combat debris
							Tetron claims that he heard about it after we came through
						How'd they get past?
							Passengers are magical
								This catches Tetron's interest - he asks to speak with them
									Weird ask, they're busy
									Tetron flexes noble status - CRIT SUCCESS COURTLY GRACES
									The driver agrees to consult the passengers
										While this happens, Tetron messages Margot to fill her in and ask if she has any interest
											She def can't come, but she'll take any info he can find
										After some discussion, Tetron is invited to come into the cart
			Tetron boards the cart
				Red velvet-lined interior, but otherwise spartan
				Two individuals
					Both severe in vibe
					One is larger and takes up most of the rear of the wagon
						Tatted up (arcane tattoos)
						Hairstyle resembles a mullet
						Warlord kind of vibe
					Other is a smaller lady sitting opposite
						Dressed in red
						Long black hair
						Seems a bit put off
				The man says the driver gave the impression of Tetron
					Tetron says that he's impressed by their dealing with of the creature
					Introduces himself as Marquis Eligor Kaulfield
					The woman is Marquisee Ravana Kaulfield
					They know of House Hyperius
						Specifically Merginius's deeds
					The Marquisee asks Tetron's business in Cassomir
						He says he was about to ask the same
						Headed for an art show
							They know of it
						They're just in town for a moment and then intend to turn back
							They're meeting with someone who has done business with their son
								IRIS
								Tetron says he's not familiar with them having a son
									Not surprising, he's a disgrace
								Tetron is interested in what their aims are
									"Weak snivelling coward with no power"
								Tetron "offers" to help with the search for their son
									They propose that Tetron help them connect with his family
										Tetron knows that his mom swerves diabolism on principle
										He says he can put in a good word, regardless
								Why travel this far out?  Why not just disown?  What's at stake?
									Their son continues to use the name, so no disowning
									So they need to "prune the bush"
							Where can he find them in Cassomir?
								Not staying directly in town
					They take their leave
			As he walks away, he moves to place a sigil on the Kaulfields' cart
	Back in the Heartwood
		Viola sees ghosts
			She starts freaking the fuck out
			Timpani reports that Viola sees "so many ghosts"
				Krug and Iris just chalk this up to the ambrosia
			Double-checking the plan
				Presenting Viola to the big bird
				Iris wants Krug to keep going while she goes to find Alistair
				Krug covers Viola's eyes
					She freaks out more
		Alistair at the store
			Yak-man and a Tian woman attending
			Alistair browses
			Lots of druidic and natural stuff
				Things that would otherwise be uncommon or rare
				There's a basket in the back labelled "restricted"
					Smells kind of good, almost like peaches and citrus
				He browses for a bit, not especially interested
			Krug, Iris, Viola, and Timpani show up
				The woman notices how Viola isn't doing so good
					Warns against bird obesity
					They have special feed
					The yak-man notes that Viola isn't actually a bird
				Iris asks if they have a way to get Viola to regurgitate
					Hard for layfolk to do that themselves
					Birds generally regurgitate on their own
					The woman can help
				How to keep the other birds from swarming us?
					They can sell us a snuff box
				Krug hands over Viola
					The woman starts poking and prodding at Viola's stomach
						She hates that and wiggles free, flying out of the store
							But she's still fading in and out of consciousness
							When awake, she can see the spiritual energy emitting from the pools, and also more ghosts
							Once Krug and co exit the store, she flies to him for safety
				Iris asks if there's something to make Viola throw up
					Not without ruining the ambrosia
					What about putting Viola to sleep
						The yak-man has the sleep spell
						Viola fails the save
				Ambrosia extraction successful
					But only half
					They poke Viola awake
						The ghosts are gone
					Krug asks how much is owed
						2 cp
						Happy to help
					Iris is fucking done with this shit
	Back through the portal
		The birds know about the ambrosia
			Viola warns
		Tetron sees us return
		We approach the large bird
			Krug reports half-success
			Viola complains about being turned into the one thing that would make her go crazy about the ambrosia
				Best way to find it is to be a bird
				But it made me high!
					Not high, seeing ghosts
					Big bird wants to reunite with its master
		Tetron just deadass drops that walking to Eligor and Ravana was lovely
			Iris is immediately pissed
			Tetron said we had visitors
			Iris rants about all the other bullshit she was up to, and 
			Iris wants to catch up with them
				They're too fast
			Iris figures that her parents aren't looking for her in Cassomir, probably someone else
				They're probably going to kill her friend
			Margot filled in
				She isn't thrilled with Tetron having chatted with two of the most prominent Chelaxian warlords
				There's nothing that she knows that Iris doesn't
					Tetron wants to hear it out anyway
						Firmly entrenched in Chelaxian politics
						Eligor is a physical combatant
							The tats are physical enhancements
						Ravana specializes in magic and espionage
							Reknowned torture methods
					Tetron asks what weaknesses Iris knows about
						They were absent enough for her to not have much insight into their lives
						Engaging them in a battle of wits is a dead-end
							Iris admits to being the least learned among House Kaulfield
			Iris wants to get a move on
				Krug asks whether it's possible they have intel on Iris's movements, rather than it being her friend
				She could not sleep well at night if something would happen to Patia
				We move as quickly as we can
Moonday evening
	It's the time to make camp
		Our conjured horses don't last long enough to press on through the night 
	Krug asks if there's a way to warn Patia
		Tetron is already working on scrolls of sending
			And Iris can use scrolls
		We're four days out from Cassomir
			Even if Iris's parents were twice as fast as us, they won't make it before the scrolls are ready
Skipping to Wealday evening
	Terrain gradually transitioning to swamp
	Viola's not a bird anymore
	It occurs to Tetron that they would know the various means by which we used to slay the cyclops, meaning that they have intel on party comp
	Tetron acknowledges that Iris's parents' primary gripe is that she continues to use the Kaulfield name
		That's the point
		Tetron would prefer to have some kind of tactical advantage
			Iris: "Can you form tactics for an avalanche?"
	The scrolls of sending are successfully crafted, and Tetron distributes them
	Tetron asks what next
		Haste
	Iris uses her sending scroll
		Message: Patia, it's Iris.  Beware my parents are coming to Cassomir coming to find you.  Stay safe.  Unyeilding guide you.
		Patia responds: Daughter of Pain, I hear your warning.  I will obscure myself in the city with powerful allies.  My cannon is yours if you fight.
	Watches:
		Iris and Viola, Tetron and Alistair, Krug
Wealday night
	First watch
		Viola apologizes for the ambrosia incident
			This turns into a discussion about Viola's fighting style, Iris's goal to become House Kaulfield, and garnering Arazni's favor
				Iris's plan has always been to kill her parents first so as to give house headship to Abigale before enacting her revenge
				Iris's arm was lost due to showboating against Abigale
	Second watch
		Alistair notices rattling from the cargo again
			He muses that we could get the Kaulfields to open the cargo
		Alistair asks if Tetron could teach him some cantrips
			Tetron's down, and Alistair offers Warp Step in exchange
	Third watch
		Krug all by his lonesome
Oathday morning
	We pass a massive cavern system rising out of the swamp to our south
	Tetron considers whether the Kaulfields could have found some kind of shortcut
		Possible other means of transit...
	Tetron would prefer if we had a more efficient means to traverse the swamp, but the cargo and the small access we have to flight makes that an impossibility
	We start seeing patrols again
Oathday evening
	As the sun sets, we can just make out the glow of Cassomir's lights cast against the sky
	Watches: Iris and Tetron, Alistair
Oathday night
	First watch
		Tetron asks who did end up raising Iris if her parents didn't
			Slaves
			He imagines it's not nearly as personal as it would be for the Taldan equivalent
				She got a sense for their true feelings
			Did Iris look up to anybody?
				As a child, Abigale
					Despite the abuse
					And her never respecting Iris
					Ended abruptly upon loss of arm
				Subsequently, Patia
					Her prostheticist
		Tetron: what would you do after revenge
			Saying "whatever I want" would be a cop-out
			Claim the name "Kaulfield" for herself and use it for other purposes than Hell, such as Arazni's glory, Andoran, or the Bellflower Network
		Iris compliments Tetron's astuteness and acknowledges him not really fitting in with the rest of the team
			What caused him to take up adventuring?
				You can only read so many books
				Cop-out answer: "builds character", real answer: how to get more powerful
		Iris notices a white snake dart into the underbrush
			She's not aware of white snakes being native to swamps, Tetron agrees
			Tetron's not aware of a spell that specifically conjures white snakes, which means it's likely a familiar
		Iris mentions that Viola apologized
			Iris can't really accept, though
				As Krug can't lie
			Tetron: Viola's a major asset
				Sharp tongue
	Second watch
		Alistair all on his lonesome
	Third watch
		Nothing eventful
		Iris dreams about being in a cave
			She looks down from the ceiling
			Dozens huddled in the corner, women, children, elderly, injured
				Plus a smattering of folks looking to the entrance
			Rushed footfalls
				People come in, saying that "they're" almost upon them and that those of the refugees who can make it should flee
				One person with dual scimitars is determined to defend
			Iris's father casually walks into this chamber, a Bellflower hideout
				He grabs a child by the head, its skin dissolves, and he raises its skull
				He systematically murders each of the chamber's occupants
					But he stops with the last person, the woman with the scimitars
						He turns to his wife, the woman in his hands
						"This one will make a fine servant"
			Iris recognizes that this would be an event that would have happened following her own departure
Fireday morning
	The caverns appear to be devoid of industrial activity and just left alone
	Watch towers start showing up
	Tetron asks what we do when we get there
		First thing is Margot and the cargo
		Iris: Make sure Patia's safe
		Viola: Save the Olgirs
	Tetron: where should we stay?
		Viola's been there a few times
			But stuck to caravan spots
		Iris lived there, but she didn't really go out and about
			Largely stuck to the Andoran side
		Tetron's mom's family home is here, so he's familiar with the nice areas
Fireday evening
	We arrive at the gates of Cassomir
		There's a security check line
			Security seems higher than before
	Margot and cargo headed for Taldan side
		Which means we need to go through border control
	Border control
		We see homeless people
		A boy makes a break for the bridge and is kicked back by a Taldan guard
		We're let through without incident
	To House Vaylen
		Down a market street and into the Amber Trellis neighborhood
		When we approach, a person perks up and waves us in
			She offers to take the cart into the garage
			We report no damage
		A servant will bring us the funds
		A man in overdone fine clothes comes out to collect Margot
			He goes on and on complimenting Margot's beauty
			She goes right into playing into him
			Tetron wishes her well
				"Blink twice if you're under duress"
				He tells her to tap the IMG if she needs us
					She offers to turn over any info she gets about the Kaulfields or the Aegis Coalition
		We end up standing there for a while
		We're handed the payment and left alone
	Now what?
		Need to find an inn
			Viola: Andoran or Taldor side?  We'll need to cross the border a bunch anyway.
				Probably safer for Iris if we stay in Andoran
		Iris checks in with Patia
			She's deep in Hosetter
	We head back to West Cassomir
		Modest inn in New Codwin
		Nicer inn in Deepspring
		Iris wants to be closer to Hosetter, so she'd prefer the New Codwin one for tonight
	Inn
		Tetron scans for suspect characters
			He notices a sneering dwarf woman looking straight at the party
				She demands that we order something or leave
					Viola: we were hoping for a bed
						We're put up in their last room, with only four beds
							Krug immediately volunteers to take the floor
	Bedtime
Starday morning
	A voice rings out, accusing a man of messing someone of messing with "one of the girls"
		Afterward, the voice yells at someone complaining about the bacon
	To Hosetter
		Tetron asks whether someone should look into the Olgir situation
			Alistair: you guys don't like it when I wander off and snoop
			Viola: we don't like when you do that without telling us
			Alistair excuses himself
		Grabbing breakfast along the way
		We hear someone call out "Well if it isn't Ms. Wanda Carson"
			It's Harold, a hobgoblin, who makes apple cakes that she liked as a kid
			Tetron covers for Viola
			As an apology for the "mis-ID", he provides one on the house the way that Wanda liked
	At Hosetter
		Iris asks to see Patia
			We're escorted once our credentials are verified
		We brought down multiple basement levels and then through a trap door
		We enter the room containing Patia and her cannon
			She's cleaning it
			She stands to greet and hug Iris
			"You brought friends!"
				Iris introduces the Radiant Dawn
				She's impressed that we got Iris's attention
					Viola mentions that we pissed off Abigale
			Patia explains that her accommodations are temporary
			Iris asks if she's gotten intel on her parents
				Patia brings out a map: pins on Port Authority, Deepspring, and Isamaco Courtyard
					Potential intel points
				The cart bearing House Kaulfield's colors was identified
					Headed straight for the Taldan side
				Iris says that this is probably the best opportunity
			Iris hands over the dread wraith robes
				She takes it and secures it in a secondary container
			Patia once again offers her help against the Kaulfields
			Patia informs Iris of an associate
				Haven't been in the city for some time
				In case it's useful, she's mentioning us to Hakim Scutchpenny
					Operates in Oppara and Galt
					Inventor and artificer
					Fellow "follower" (read: Arazni)
						One of few trying to do good in Galt
					Currently on business in Oppara
					Dwarf, dread fauxhawk, scraggly beard, mechanical arm that rises from his back in addition to his regular arms, uses a heavy crossbow
					Specifically works against the Aegis Coalition
			Patia warns us that we're "terribly apparent"
				Iris wishes to find some place to reduce collateral damage
			Iris asks the status of Patia's workshop
				The main one has already been razed, reportedly
				The one here at Hosetter is intact, but her supplies are gone
			Tetron asks where would be a good place to fight
				Where would the Kaulfields go next?
				Patia also does work in Cur's Tooth, but that absolutely is no place for a battle
				Tetron suggests staging Iris coming upon Patia's workshop unknowing
			Iris asks if Patia knew if her arm would turn out to be a conduit to Arazni
				Patia takes this symbolically, but Iris corrects her that it's literal
				"You contacted Arazni?"
					Yeah.  And she even responded.
				Arm appears to have been the conduit
				Patia will carry this as a point of pride
			Patia recommends that we gather reliable allies as quickly as possible
	Over to Alistair
		He looks for a back-alley to change into street clothes
		Starts wandering around New Codwin, looking for...
			Thieves' signs
			Merchants with contacts
			Sewer entrances or other furtive means of moving about the city
			Looking for C&T warehouse that Dorfinn told him about
		Sewer systems
			Andoran and Taldan sides not connected
			Both systems robust
		Merchants
			Large orc woman chopping meat, next to a kid with a scratched-out face
				The kid used to be at Tamuth House but was adopted for his swimming prowess
					His name is Troy
					Did not train under the Greencloaks
				Troy notices him and tugs at the woman to get Alistair's attention
				Troy asks what Alistair is doing here
					Stuff came up
					Secret
					Things are fine
				Alistair asks if Troy knows anyone similar to what he and the others were up to
					The orc chimes in: look for Tarik the Unclean in Cur's Tooth
						She offers to make an introduction even
						Either he can wait for the lunch rush to die down or come back later
							He'll come back later
		Other street urchins
			Not much in the way of crime in New Codwin or Deepspring
				State-sponsored social support systems
			However, he does notice a girl dart out of Cur's Tooth into Deepspring
				She's scarred and missing hair
				Definitely up to something
				Alistair follows
					She ends up down in Warbler's Perch
					She cuts a purse of a middle-aged woman, then ducks into an alleyway to look through her loot
					She then starts to leave, but Alistair approaches her, signing friendliness
						What do you want?
							New to town, hoping for an introduction to those in the trade
							Compliments her purse-cutting
							What sort of contact?
								Info
									Already heard of Tarik, but anyone else?
									Nah, Tarik is who he wants
										But she reports to an older goblin woman
											Something a caretaker for the orphans
									She has an older teen friend who kind of occupies that space
								Or even a larger org
									No org
		C&T Warehouse
			Signs directing toward the warehouse
			From the exterior, it looks mundane
	Back with the others
		Where to now?
		Tetron realizes that he could use sending to speak directly to Amos
			Yeah, let's do it
			"Amos, it's Tetron.  We want to save you.  Where are you?  Who has you?"
			No response
		Viola: let's check in with the IMG
			It's on the Taldan side
			We shouldn't cross the border without Alistair
		Iris: Suppose we could check the burnt-out workshop
	Back with Alistair at C&T
		They're a local hub for the Bellflower Network
		Alistair introduces himself and name-drops Dorfinn
			Asks about...
				Kaulfields
					They have a big ol' file on them
					Responsible for the destruction of multiple of the Network's safehouses
					Alistair asks if they already know about Iris's parents being in town
						This causes a panicked all-hands meeting
						He explains what he knows to those assembled, but omits his association with the Radiant Dawn or Iris
						They're scrambling people to start looking for the Kaulfields
				Aegis Coalition
					One hotspot known: agents coming in-and-out of a section of Greyguard Castle, probably reporting to someone there
				Olgirs
					No knowledge
				Problems in town that we could help with?
					NEXT SESSION
	At Patia's burnt-out workshop
		The structure doesn't even really exist anymore
		Tetron realizes that he can message Alice instead.
			"Alice, it's Tetron.  We want to save Amos.  If you're safe, where can we meet you?  If not, where can we find Amos?"
			Response: NEXT SESSION
