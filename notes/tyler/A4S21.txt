Almas, Wealday Afternoon
	We have a bunch of time until we need to be back in the Heartwood
		Weapons turned in for rune transfer
			Have to do so at the Cerulean Keep
		Alistair decides to head over to Tamuth House
			Renovations complete
			Alistair's previous training has been effective
		Krug goes to assist the portal tunnel widening
		Viola goes to collect from Chase the Liar
			57 gp
			Fully paid off
	Meanwhile, Iris is gritting her teeth through the tattoo
		Magical tattoos have different pain
	Viola decides to kill more time by heading to the Cerulean Keep
		She reports that Constable Cheliff is Coalition and asks if Andoran has intel on her
		Zenza is happy to help
			Info delivered to SunnySide
	A few hours later, at SunnySide
		Reconvene
		Cheliff intel comes in
			Ties to militant group that was loyalist (against Eutropia)
				Which hasn't quite been stamped out by Eutropia
				Has alt-right leanings
Port back to Heartwood
	Meeting is being held at the Hall of Wild Ambrosia
		Tradition is to hold meal prior to big discussions
			All veg
			Honeysuckle wine
		Iris sitting with the tattoo artist
		Moths standing up against the wall
		All "pillars of the community" here, plus various other local adults
		Archdruids stand in unison
			They ask for opponents to make themselves known and make their case
				No opposition, though
			They've built a structure to house the egg
				In a bushy tree
				Bryoni places the egg in the center of the nest
	Alistair asks Mabel whether there's a portal closer to Cassomir
		She doesn't know
		Who else would know?
			Archdruid of Lichen, probably
				Okay to approach with such an inquiry?  He seems pretty aloof
					Good point, but may want to consider why we want this info
					Mabel doesn't really ever talk to them
						They're intimidating (Bryoni less so)
	Iris resumes tattoo
Back in Almas
	SunnySide
		Iris and Tetron's room is available
		Krug and Viola sleep on couches
		Alistair just goes to crash at Tamuth House
Oathday morning
	We get our shit
	Back to the portal
		It's bootie time
	Back in Cassomir after portal and teleport spell
		Well, close enough
			We appear out in the swamp
			There are a few person-sized white snakes
				They were staring intently at each other, but they book it as soon as we arrive
				Tetron had seen a normal-sized white snake on the trip to Cassomir
			In the opposite direction of Cassomir to us, there's a cliffside with a ton of holes in it
				Likely the Kodarod Caverns
					Alistair remembers: where the serpentine guy at Cur's Tooth is employed
					Tetron knows: used to be a place to harvest mushroom, but not anymore
				But yeah, back to town
					Friends to save, parents to stab
	Actually back to Cassomir
		So, how to get into Greyguard?
			Amos and Sabrina
		We arrive in Cassomir to find buildings smoking after being on fire
			A guard house and a couple of nearby buildings
				Taldan side
			Not the same sort of attack as the one on Patia's workshop
			Tetron goes to ask about this
				Guard mentions an incident with a noble family
					Doesn't know who
		Ideas for getting into Greyguard
			Alistair could ask around in Cur's Tooth, but he has a better idea: ask at Hosetter
		To Hosetter
			We ask for LTC Buracir
			After a bit, she is able to see us
			Viola explains the situation regarding investigating Cheliff and rescuing Amos
				Buracir: Is he inside or beneath?
					We describe our analysis
					From our description, the location is further beneath the castle than it actually goes
						Or at least not as far as her intel knows
						She recommends finding an alternate entrance, as going through the castle is unlikely
				However, getting at Cheliff still may require castle access
					Viola: we may be able to put pressure on her without direct confrontation
						She explains the meeting they had and the intel on her affiliation with the loyalist faction
			Buracir remembers to tell Iris that her parents have been sighted
				Staying in interdimensional spaces, generally placed in a certain area (Deepspring, on Taldan side)
			Back to the matter of Cheliff
				Tunnels beneath Greyguard would be incredibly difficult
				But Kodarod and the tunnel out of the Bains' basement is precident
			Tetron brings up the snakes
				Buracir has only heard whispers
			Buracir directs us to Patia after we're done
				She suggests that folks from the Bellflower Network (and herself) should be permitted to gang up on the Kaulfields once we've weakened them
				But how would this interface with Iris's plan for vengeance?
					Iris wants to kill her mom first
						Wants to curse her, specifically with never mind
					Iris wishes for them to die by her hand specifically
			Next steps
				Alistair goes to Cur's Tooth to inquire about the snakes
				Rest of us go to check on the Vaylens
				Plan to meet at the tunnel entrance to the Bains'
	To the Taldan side
		We arrive in the Amber Trellis
			It got burned
			Tetron asks whether anyone survived
				17 casualties, largely staff and servants
				Matriarch is dead
				Son (Margot's fiance) is dead
				Many still missing
			Where are the survivors?
				Some being treated for burns
					Where?
						Staging area in the next yard over
			Viola: Children?
				Two corpses found
			We head over to the staging area
				Margot is severely injured and unconscious but alive
				Other Vaylens have survived
			Tetron goes to check whether Margot has anything of interest on her person
				A note!
				Four graphics along the top of naked men
					Like the vitruvian man
				Below is what appears to be a speech draft
					Coalition rhetoric about Amos's betrayal
	Out to the tunnel exit
		Waiting for Alistair
		Tetron looks for a cypher in the text
			No cypher
			But it's referring to things opaquely
			It does refer to three of the four magical essences
	Cur's Tooth
		Alistair consults with Tariq the Unclean about tunnels beneath Greyguard
			No definitive knowledge, but he does have an associate who does
				Can't introduce personally
				But find the largest tunnel into the Kodarod Caverns
				Locate Coimbitor the Generous
					Only refer to him by full title (offensive otherwise)
			Alistair mentions the white snakes
				"If you find one, follow it."
				They're his associates
		Anything else Tariq needs help with?
			Know anything about folks appearing and disappearing nearby?
				Alistair lets him know they're dangerous
				Inform the Bellflowers or the authorities about their whereabouts
	Out at the tunnel exit
		We enter briefly, see folks, and get the hell out
	Back into the city
		Over to Deepspring to ask around about the Kaulfields
			Iris is hoping for a pattern
			It's a row along the border between Deepspring and Cur's Tooth
				Pretty frequently travelled
	To Kodarod, then
		Trudging through the swamp
		Alistair leading, Krug bringing up the rear
		Alistair keeping an eye out for white snakes, but finds trails that they left behind
		We enter a tunnel, come to a fork, and take the more travelled side
		Another choice: big vs small -> we pick big
		We see a flickering light in the distance
			We can hear conversation
				"The state of this individual is a bit precarious."
				Alistair hears the voice of the lizard guy from Cur's Tooth respond
			We push open stone doors
		Inside
			Six or seven large serpents, plus the lizard
			The largest serpent is hooded, wearing fine apparel and a top hat
			They're standing around a body
			Coimbitor the Generous greets us
				Wants secrets in exchange for info on getting beneath Greyguard
					Story of Aegis Coalition
					Tessra's suicide
				Turns out the body is Khadija
					She's alive, but suffering from some kind of possessive curse
						Scarabs all around
							Iris suggests that it may be an Arazni thing
								Oh, new approach to treating Khadija: religious
									Some kind of spirit thing is shunted out and scatters to the wind
				Satisfactory
					Directions to an old tunnel
						Used to be a spy hideout
					Additional info on offer
						Nearest Alseta gate?
							One nearby was destroyed a long time ago
							The closest extant one in the Ruins of Nazilli
								The place was the victim of a major dragon attack
									Sometimes still plays host to red and green dragons
								Don't know the sign
						The Kaulfields?
							Nope
					Otherid'Noq the Flip-Paw Father
						A very brief flash of emotion
						Says to have history with him
						Do we wish to kill him?
							Yes
							Can't kill in this realm
						Issue between them?
							Snakes and big cats generally don't get along
							Also got kicked out of Oppara by him
						Warning
							Cunning and full of tricks
							And has brute strength once the tricks run out
						Working with the Aegis Coalition, but not part of it
				Viola asks him to let Khadija know to find us via the Bellflowers
		Iris considers the spirit she saw leave Khadija's body
			It's Tessra
			Being raised as something else is a huge honor
			Vindictive spirit now
			Retains some knowledge of her mortal life
				Particularly in regard to how she was wronged in life
			Might have some domain in regard to betrayals
			Iris wants her hatred for herself
			Viola: why Khadija before any of us?
				Tetron, Iris, and Viola consult...
					Definitely not specific to Khadija, could have instead been a way to fuck with us indirectly
					And it hurts more when it's done to the allies
					Also, could be lethal to weaker folks
			Iris wants to chat with Patia about this
	To the tunnel
		Viola: we should pick up Borgon first
			At the Black Pit Tavern
				The front desk person hails us
					Tells us that Margot got something from Khadija
						Ah, we already did that
				Borgon changed the room's theme
				We collect Borgon
				Iris lingers to configure the room herself
					Marble, soft blue lighting, fountains lining the walls, a sprawling bed space in the middle, silk strung along the rafters
		Oh, but we can check if Margot is awake yet
			She's leaned up against a wall and drinking through a straw
			She can't speak, but Tetron messages her
				Khadija brought her the note
				Also more info
					Amos is in great danger
					Being held somewhere accessed via Roani Cheliff's office
					She came in distraught, gave the note and info, then left
		Through the tunnel
			Long, winding, arduous
			Verticality
			Borgon and Pellsieve are able to guide the way
			We come upon an ordinary door, just sitting in the bored earth
				The sounds of soft undulation from within
				Alistair verifies no traps
