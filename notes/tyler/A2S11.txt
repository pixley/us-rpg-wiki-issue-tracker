Zaknos wakes up
	Chimpy demonstrates invisibility and alternate forms
	He asks a bar patron where the rest of us went: church of Shelyn
	Jade tells him that we went to the church of Abadar
Church of Abadar
	Viola and Tetron check in and wait
	Zaknos shows up and interacts with a guard dog
	Viola called in, has to remove shirt
		Failure
	Viola refunded half the cost (40 of 80)
	Tetron realizes that he doesn't have enough money for even a 4th-level remove curse
	Chimpy offers to make a pact for the difference, Zaknos declines
	Zaknos does have enough, and offers it in exchange for getting help with *anything* he asks for
	As Tetron goes in, Zaknos feeds the dog
		It is not a dog.  It has a tentacle mouth.  It's a mage-hunting dog.
		Apparently, they're common in Oppara
	Tetron puts forth the bag of weasels
		Success
	Tetron goes to pat Zaknos and manages to clip Chimpy
Alistair stakeout
	The man emerges, wearing business or religious clothes, carrying a book
	He heads for the temples district
	Alistair moves to break in
	The maid had also left, but he hasn't seen a butler
	Likely others inside
	Alistair chugs an invisibility pot and heads for the house, making an effort to avoid the dog, and jumps the fence
	He moves to the sunroom; there is a nearby cracked kitchen window with a cooling bread loaf on the sill
	He heads around the house toward the study
	Inspecting the sitting window: it isn't trapped, and he's able to jimmy the window open quietly
	Dude apparently likes music: piano and multiple string instruments
	Small shrine to Sarenrae in one corner
	Door to study, opens with small whine
	More Sarenrae stuff in the study
	Looking for valuables
		Sarenrae stuff is the most valuable; Alistair doesn't steal religious stuff
		Magic pendant? - TAKEN
		Safe with complex, but not impossible lock
		Desk drawers:
			Letters with no addresses
		Quick glance at books on desk:
			About Sarenrae, forgiveness, repentance
			Third book: about different planes of existence - open to basic info about outer planes
				Note on it: "Research planes", "She might be in any of them", "Shining hair of gold like wheat" (this is circled a bunch), "saw boy in front of temple... sign?", "Prepare for trip... withdraw funds"
			End-of-life prep?  Coffin, next-of-kin, what to do with remains
			Name found: Sir Leyten Danamark
		Done browsing - safe now:
			Safe appears to be trapped: opening without correct key deploys poisonous spike; could do collateral damage even if he avoids it
			Alistair remembers having seen a keyring on the guy
			Mechanism would be time-consuming: 4 or 5 minutes
			Disable trap attempt: broke some small bit inside - success
			Picking the lock: takes a moment, but success
			Contents:
				Small opal - taken
				Intricate mask that covers the eyes - taken
				2 tickets to some art gallery event - left
				Small diamond - taken
				Silver ornamental dagger wrapped in thin gauze - taken
				Old Sarenraen book that seems incredibly valuable - left
Zaknos and Nilbog have breakfast sandwiches
	Viola pitches her plan for the Pinelli thing
	Tetron pitches looking into other quests, esp. porcelain bowl one
	Viola muses about the Zven thing (where's Ali?)
	Viola asks what they should do about cops
		Conclusion: solve the riddle, take what's inside, give empty brooch to Barnes
Back at house
	Alistair starts to leave; hears clacking of heels in the hallway
	Escapes before pot runs out
Party arrives at Gardenia House
	Different servant greets us; we're led to tea room
	Margaret is waiting for us
	Viola presents the political activism lie; suggests political tension as issue between Margaret and Blaire
	Margaret buys it, mission accomplished: 140 gp
		Individual share: 23.33 gp
Alistair returns to his inn room
	Read aura on pendant, mask, and dagger
		Pendant: Abjuration
		Mask: Not magic
		Dagger: Not magic
	Alistair heads to Zven's
		Zven is working on paperwork
		Presents opal, diamond, mask, dagger
		Total: 200(diamond)+40(opal)+10(mask)+20(dagger)
Back to inn to wait for Ali and decode brooch
	Tetron has heard of "shade" and "hue" in the technical sense on account of different flags representing different allegiences
	Center gem can slide out to form ring, a gem in the ring can be shifted to center
	Brooch's right side: red-top, clockwise rainbow order
		Clicks into place
	Brooch's left side: Viola figures out that darkvision can be used to sort by shade; it's given to Krug
		Clicks into place
	Brooch opens in Krug's hands
		The mouth is a handle, it opens like double doors
	Stained glass pin in interior
		There's a hole in the middle
		Has writing, but it's in Varisian: "faith, true sight, loyalty"
			Tetron: it's not a house crest, but he notices that weapons portrayed are not of Taldan make, the sword is ceremonial, probably religious, but he doesn't know what
				Heavily flowing water, either ocean or large river (perhaps Sellen, Inner Sea?)
			Krug: hasn't seen anything like this before
	Alistair shows up and Viola explains the situation
	Read aura: inside has abjuration on it; outside is mechanical
	Zaknos wonders if Chimpy knows anything about it; he goes to the bathroom, but announces it in a sus way
		Chimpy doesn't know; he was just going to report it to his superiors
		He's reporting everything to his superiors
			Janice - he's afraid of her
			Three other bosses - three big scary women
				Nicest is Rianne (sp?), who gives him snacks
				Worst is Haley (?), who is super into revenge
				Middle is Astrid, she's okay
		Zaknos warns him to avoid being touched
		How far can he be from token?  Unknown, but he's supposed to always watch
		Zaknos dismisses him for the time being
			He can't perceive anything from in there, except for stuff that's super close to the token
	Codename: Toast
	Viola suggest that they do some research, perhaps at the library
		She suggests that maybe Felix could help since he hangs out there all the time
		Viola realizes that they totally forgot to tell Felix about the Allison situation
At the library
	Viola asks about Alseta material and mentions that they found out what happened to Allison
		Lamoth says that Felix left town a few days prior
	Viola is led to books about Alseta, doesn't learn anything
		No Alsetan phrases or mottos are even remotely similar to the one found on the pin
	Tetron looks for stuff relating to cults and other minor faiths along the Sellen
		Imagery of a hand reaching for another is evocative of drowning
		Nothing else particularly helpful, but he does have a small lead, it seems
		He finds Nilbog looking through some books that he could actually reach
			Could a bucket of water be brought to the inn?  Tetron needs enough to put his face in.
			Nilbog goes to a well outside and fills his bucket hat
			Tetron puts the pin on, albeit under his clothes, then tries to intentionally start to drown
				He starts to drown and pulls his face back out; hypothesis disproven
	Next step: talk to Sloane?
	Zaknos pulls us aside: he admits to having been talking to Chimpy and his surviellance of us
		He describes Chimpy's bosses
		Three erinyes, not one
To Sloane's
	Guards recognize us and bring us in
	She gives us a payout in recognition of how much higher the stakes were than she was led to believe
	She has an additional job for us if we come back, it involves travel to Almas and the Iomedean
		Ship to Almas paid for by her if we take the job
	Alistair asks if there's more about his "friend"
		Rest of party exits
		Ali's former guild is not doing well
		Dorfin is in jail (indefinite time) in Almas, charges serious
		New person in charge
		Lots have left, either to more serious criminal pursuits, backed out completely, or decided to join the military instead
		While Andoren politics are slow, there is due process
		Might be able to meet Dorfin if he makes it to Almas in the next few weeks
		Sloane had pleasant interaction with Dorfin
			Better than a lot of other guilds
			Other do human trafficking
		Word of caution: Almas might not be the same when he returns
		She'll keep an ear out, but it seems like there are multiple groups vying in the power vacuum
		Sloane is happy that Alistair came, wishes him well
	Viola inquires about the whole Zven/JK thing from the night before
		She's disappointed in the bad info she had relating to the situation
		Viola asks whether Zven was the source of that bad info: Sloane is surprised at the name-drop
		Viola warns that Zven has had an interest in Joan's affairs for a long time
		Sloane seems to already be aware of JK; it's not an organization
			Zven maintains multiple "identities"
Outside Sloane's
	Alistair asks Tetron to take a look at the pendant he found 
		It's a corpse ward pendant: undetectable to undead for 10 minutes
		Back to inn: Tetron's idea is to put the pendant in the toast's exterior
			IT FITS
		Tetron is able to identify the brooch's magic: magically-shrunken Shield of Aroden
