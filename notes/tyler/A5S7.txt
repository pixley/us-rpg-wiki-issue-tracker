Cassomir, Starday late afternoon
	In the bowels of the Admiralty Citadel
		A female gnome is finally able to clear the Never Mind curse
			She gets paid by the soldiers
			Dominic also got cured previously
		Viola verifies with Iris that the others went to Almas
			Yup
		So what now?
			Also, why stay with Viola?
				The others wanted to go more
			Iris wants to go back across the river
	Iris leads Viola to Hosetter
		Buracir: "I was looking forward to speaking with you."
			Iris tells her that the Bains are dead
			She asks whether the party is whole and well
				Yup
			She starts talking about the Cheliff situation
				She asks what our plans are
					She looks at Iris, then Viola
						Viola: I was hit by a Never Mind
				She verifies that we haven't had any leaks
					She affirms that she won't leak anything herself unless under dire circumstances
						That would be very bad for Andoren-Taldan relations
				We need to prove that the killing wasn't actually a crime
					Buracir: Yes, that would be good
					Iris wants Cheliff's address
						Buracir is taken aback by this and turns to Viola
							Viola: That's where we would probably find incriminating evidence, as her office at Greyguard would be inaccessible
							Buracir resigns herself to the point being good
								Can we at least promise to not make a scene out of it
									Of course
							Buttoncrest, Floor 4
								Clearwater District - It's nice
							Caution: Cheliff's wife is a prominent city official
								Iris: Well, let's go when she's not there
									She's heavily pregnant
			Anything else we need?
				Iris: Info on Chelaxian agents
					Had some folks looking into it, but had to pause
						Chester Zenza, junior officer in the effort, went missing yesterday
Meanwhile, in Almas
	Over in the university
		While Tetron is asking around regarding to other matters, Alistair is in the library
			While reading into the general topic of the primal well water, it occurs to him that Good Sir Gourdon might be interested in it
	To the Velour Grotto
		Alistair presents it to Gourdon, who enthusiastically asks how much it'll sell for
			Alistair has no idea, but he trusts Gourdon to make a fair offer
			Gourdon asks to take a small sample to verify it
				OH IT'S THAT GOOD SHIT
				However, it would be dangerous or even fatal for a normal humanoid to drink
					Even if you survived, you wouldn't be the same person at the other end
				He makes an offer for 2800 gp for the whole waterskin-full
					Accepted
				He pours the whole thing into his jar
					He hulks the fuck out
					He's incredibly pleased
	After muliple hours and making contacts, they manage to sell the censer and incense
	Tetron sells Baron Bain's outfit
Back in Cassomir
	Iris feels multiple keys on Cheliff's key ring turn
	The two return to the Black Pit Tavern
		Viola is the first to see Iris's work
	At 7:10 pm, while Iris is in the bath, she receives a message
		Her eyes and head are turned off to the left
		Arazni whispers in her ear
			"I move upon my enemies; watch as yours move too."
			She gets a vision of three individuals in an upscale home
				Iris's parents seated, with a third individual holding a box taking a silvery thread and putting it on a pelt
				There is an auction ongoing, and they're leaving town once it's finished
					The auction was delayed due to Cheliff's disappearance
					It will happen in two days
					The box will be delivered by then
				The third person is Iris's grandmother
		Iris gets out of the bath, towels off, dresses to the minimum for polite company
			She approaches Viola, who's scribbling out her notes on how to resolve the Cheliff situation
			Iris explains that her grandmother is attending this auction
			After some discussion, Iris figures that it's time to address The Box
				But Alistair has the box
			Iris shares the vision she had with the heart
			The two have a deep philosophical discussion
	The others return
		It's payday!
		Alistair reports that he sold the well water
			Viola: Who the hell did you sell it to?
				Good Sir Gourdon
				And Alistair finally mentions to Tetron what Gourdon said about the water
		Iris reports what we've learned about the Cheliff situation
			Viola: We got Cheliff's home address, so Alistair can work his magic
			Alistair: Isn't there a pregnant woman there?
				Tetron remembers that there's a whole-ass cultural thing about making a public deal out of it
			We decide to have Alistair case the place
				Iris hands Alistair Cheliff's keys, and she explains the auto-turning thing
				As she hands them over, it occurs to her that the keys are meant to signal to all other holders that they were used
					Alistair: Eew!  No!  I'll just pick the locks.
		Iris asks Tetron what he would know about an auction
			Alistair: Maybe Sloane would know
			Iris and Tetron chat back-and-forth, and a thought occurs to Iris
				A valuable item given to Abigale was won at auction in the Carved Chamber, an auction hall below the Roaring Hall
				Almost anything could be sold there
				Tetron hasn't heard of the Carved Chamber specifically, but he is familiar with the concept of a secret high-society auction hall in major Taldan cities
					We'd need someone with connections to get in: Amos
						Can we free him in two days?
						Viola: WAIT.  The auction is a place where anything can be bought, one of the elder fey (which is required to free Amos) was taken from the Bains, the auction seems to be connected to Cheliff, which means...  We need to rescue Amos to attend the auction where we get something needed to rescue Amos
						Shit.
				How else could we get access?
					SLOANE!
					She was going to find us
					Sending
					Immediate response: It's difficult to get people in; on my way
	Alistair and Viola dip
		Alistair to get a head start on Cheliff info
		Viola to not make Sloane angry
			She offers to run errands for the others
				Runes
				Payment from Military/Police
	Alistair makes his way to Cheliff's
		He has to make a more circuitous route on account of the change in security
		He stakes out until it looks like folks have gone to bed
	Sloane shows up
		Sloane expresses doubt that we'd be able to afford anything sold there
			Yeah, we know, you think we're going to pay?
			That's what concerns Sloane; if she lets someone in who fucks with the auction, that destroys any credibility she has left
		Do we even know that the thing we're after is even there?
			It's an educated guess, but Iris's grandmother will also be there
		What's Cheliff's role in these auctions?
			Security, but she also sold servants and slaves
		We admit that the elder fey is the target
			Sloane understands what we'd need that for
		She could get ONE of us in
			The facility is heavily guarded
		Iris has an idea: if her grandmother wants the fey, we could bop her after
			Would necessitate access to her parents' Planar Palace
			She acknowledges the danger
			Sloane: Is it wise to fight on their turf?
				Iris: No, but we're short on options
			So how do we get access?
				The box!
					Krug, Iris, and Tetron get to work
					The solution relates to the years of the Thrune Ascendancy, Abigale's birth, and Iris's birth
					Three spheres, a letter, an instructional slip, a key
						The letter is for Abigale
						The spheres are golf ball-sized; distilled memories
							The slip describes their use: consume for power and knowledge
							They have images within: a key, a bloodied eye, and a room corner
							Before Iris chows down, Sloane asks if she should leave
								Iris invites her to stay
							They're hard as glass and the size of golf balls... how to "consume"?
								After much debate, Iris strains to attune to one magically to pull the memory out
									It's quite painful and takes half an hour
									The vision is of Iris's father holding a baby and a ceremonial knife
										He carves a sigil around Abigale's eye, which bleeds profusely
										He's super chill about the whole thing, despite Abigale's wails
										He places his daughter down on a stone altar
										And the blood continues to seep out over the course of hours, leaving Abigale pallid and quiet
										He finally smiles, expressing pride in Abigale's strength
									For the next week, Iris gains a +4 status bonus to Strike her father
								She puts the emptied sphere in her pocket
								She explains what she saw
									Sloane: Do you have marks like that?
										Iris: No.
										Krug: Huh?  That's normal.
										Iris relays what she told Viola earlier
							Iris waits half an hour to heal and process
							Tetron: What do you intend to do after we deal with your family?
								The entire purpose is to have the Kaulfield name all to myself.
								Tetron: So, whatever you damn well please?
									Stop the Coalition and serve Arazni
										Tetron: If you don't have a target of vengeance, what would you even do as an Araznian?
											Advise others seeking vengeance, help the Bellflowers, etc.
											I'm not going to seek out things to be mad at
							Time for sphere numero dos
								This one hurts even more, but it doesn't take as long
								The vision is of Iris's mother holding a key, and Iris was physically present in this situation
									The key is to Abigale's room
								Iris is eight or so years old
								Ravana instructs Iris to try to sneak into Abigale's room and take any one thing
								This will not be like the previous times, Iris tells herself
								Iris opens the door and finds a wealth of things
									Weapons, trinkets, toys, mechanisms, a journal
									Iris has never been in here before, only seen through a closing door
									She takes the journal
									But Iris knows that even succeeding here, she will be punished somehow
								Iris thumbs through the journal, looking for mentions of herself
									She finds the entry from the date of her most recent birthday
										Looking for how Abigale feels about Iris when their parents aren't looking
										Abigale gives a factual account of the days events
										But she also muses on Iris's treatment - likened to an old, worn-down riding shoe
											Someone without The Mark, the talent, combat skill, intelligence... still being celebrated to any extent is loathesome
											Cheliax is a country where only the strong survive, so why humor?
								Iris opens the door to leave to find Abigale having just returned from riding
								The rest of the memory is the physical retaliation
	Across the city, Alistair continues watch
		He sees a very pregnant woman enter a bedroom
	Back in the inn
		Iris is so mad that she's gripping the sphere hard enough that she might break it
			But she can't
		+4 to Strike her mother
		Iris considers the fact that these were meant for Abigale
			To remind her of her superiority?
	Alistair watching - 11 PM
		The figure opens a suitcase, and one of the keys turns: number 1
			She takes something out of the case, but her back is turned so Alistair can't see it
				She stares at it for 15 minutes, then puts it away and sits on the bed
	Back in the inn
		When Sloane asks, Iris monologues on her parents' hatred toward her
		Iris waits an hour to heal back up
		Sloane expresses her understanding in Iris's situation
			That sort of thing is why she believed in the Coalition, as her childhood was difficult
			A life guided by fate could have prevented something like that
				Or at least not having Cheliax not under the yoke of diabolism
			The first time she considered doing something else with my life was when I received a contract to kill a nine-year-old boy
				Iris: In a world guided by fate, you would have taken that contract
				But she didn't
				Iris: I suppose I should thank you
					Sloane gives a look of resolution
		Viola returns
			She's stunned to see Sloane still here and the box opened
	Over with Alistair
		Several people came and went
			Police, someone comes by briefly and then returns to give a place a look
			Door key is number 2
			Alistair can read lips!
				Gnome: Any information about her extracurricular activities would help...
				[The two change places]
				Woman: ...some afternoons she has meetings with a political group, but I don't think she was in that place
				[the two move rooms]
				Woman: ...the only other person I can think of is perhaps House Cypria, specifically Guiseppi Sedgewick, the main butler
				[the woman turns around for a while]
				Woman: ...the timing of her disappearance is convenient for others who would be gathering for the auction; she was planning to sell high-value persons - best contact would be Baulous (might still be in Oppara, though)
				Gnome: Baulous should arrive tonight at the latest
				Woman: I would check in the Roaring Hall, but only with approved vendors
				[the two leave visible rooms]
				There is a third shadowy figure visible, but it doesn't look humanoid or like a pet
	Back in the inn - 11:30 PM
		Time for sphere number 3
			Iris takes far less damage and gets in very quickly
			This moment is far easier to step into: the day Iris lost her arm
			The scene opens with the duel, like how Iris remembers it every freaking time
				An unusually sunny day
				Duel is taking place in the courtyard
			Iris felt joy in forcing Abigale to step aside finally
			She's fought Abigale so many times that she's learned the patterns
			Iris ducks to dodge the strike and also get the sun right in Abigale's eyes and gives a solid strike, drawing blood
				Every feeling of resentment has gone into cutting into Abigale's leg, with blood pouring out
			Iris is overcome with confidence and celebrates the strike, leaving her open for the retaliation: Abigale swings up
				In the first instant, there's no pain, but there's the dull wet sound of an arm hitting the ground
			Their grandmother stands in observation, alongside Iris's favorite servant
				The servant is forced to watch without aiding
				She walks over to Abigale, tends to her, then looks over at Iris with utter indifference, saying "we won't have need for training any longer"
				As Iris lays there, she watches her severed arm get burned
					It could have been reattached, she could have been made whole...
				This is the last time Iris saw Abigale
			+4 to Strike grandma
		Iris silently weeps
			Krug asks if she's okay
				No
		Iris casually tosses the sphere across the mat
		She fidgets with her hand's transformation
		She asks to not be left alone
			For once in her freaking life
		Sloane refills Iris's tea
			She gives a toast to using the past
			Iris downs it, then declares that it's time for another bath
				She looks at Sloane slightly longer as she leaves
		Sloane nurses her tea
			She looks zoned out
			When she finishes, she remarks that we've continuously surprised her with our choices and the addition to the party
				She's very special
			She's gonna chat with Iris and then bounce
		Sloane goes over to the bathroom and knocks
			Iris has just dipped her toe into the bath
			Iris asks her to enter
			Sloane acknowledges Iris's nudity
			Sloane says that she wants to express herself candidly
				She has to take a moment to find the words
				She thinks that they're cut from the same cloth
				She didn't imagine that she and Iris would come to know each other
				She's been doing some thinking: she was afraid that, seeing so much of herself in Iris that it would be difficult to be near her
					Not professionally, but personally
					Being let in
				She spent hours watching the ghost of what Iris is feeling
				Words of intention are important: I don't give a rat's ass that you weren't strong as a child or what others thought you could be
					I see you as you are now
					What I see now is someone that will wrest what she wants from the world
					I admire that and in whatever way you are comfortable with, I would like to be on that journey with you
			Iris responds that she figured that Sloane would be much more than how the others described her
				She's glad that, despite the circumstances, they've found common ground
				Also, sparing a life was a net-positive, given the hot water she's in for Cheliff
				She invites Sloane to stay or leave, whatever she likes
					Sloane asks to join in the bath and doesn't even wait for a response before unbuttoning her pants
					Her legs are covered in runic scars; with more skin revealed, their lives definitely echo each other
			Sloane props herself up on the lip of the bath
				Guess I've lied to the others
			SLIRIS IS CANON
It's 1:30 am with Alistair
	The woman says good night to someone in some other room
	The lights finally go out
