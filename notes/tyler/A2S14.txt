Thursday morning, camp outside the Arthfell Forest
	Tetron is approached by Valin
		He and Kiruka were talking
		He was wondering if he could borrow Taranis to send a message
			Max range concern
		He's nervous because we haven't contacted Marcellus
		Tetron wonders if our plan would even change Mercellus's course of action
			If he knew that we were pincering, he might wait to attack
			Not sure if he's in his right mind
		Tetron proposes: phantom steed to carry a message
			What if it gets intercepted?
				We're boned
				Likelihood of interception low, given that it's going between Marcellus and us
		What about a flare?
			Probably bad idea
		Tetron considers the phantom steed idea further...
			The wierdness of the horse would be sus
			Could send it around, which would take longer, but would be safer
		Tetron swaps the spell slot
	Kiruka looks pretty tired
		Zaknos keeping an eye on her and to take over scouting capabilities
	Tetron proposes the idea to Valin
		Alistair asks whether there's a cipher that Valin and Marcellus have
			They have a shorthand, which would be a little bit of security
		Viola suggests establishing a signal
		Tetron considers the depth of the caverns
			Asks Kiruka how deep the back entrance is
				The back entrance is where waste sediment is flushed out
				30 feet deep
		Viola proposes Alistair's horn
			Ends up being the best idea
	Valin writes the shorthanded message, and it's sent along its way with the phantom steed
		The steed is set to obey Marcellus
We set off
	Riding config
		Zaknos and Kiruka together ahead
		Alistair and Valin leading the group
		Viola on a horse by herself
		Tetron also by himself
		Krug and Nilbog together as normal
	Zaknos starts to smell something
		Putrid, like death, acidic
		He is unfamiliar with the smell
	Rest of us catch up and smell it too
		Kiruka signals to wait
		She needs to go ahead by herself to check the situation
		Zaknos accompanies
		We all dismount
	Sneaking through the brush...
		Before they reach the source of the smell, they can see movement in a clearing beyond the trees (~150 ft away)
		The shapes are adult-human sized, though one is smaller
		They seem to be talking
		Kiruka looks to Zaknos, and he looks back unknowing
		She decides to proceed forward
		Voice: "Simon, over here."
		Other voice: "Oh, hold on Sybal."
		Third voice: "I can't find him, where's Troutlicker?"
		Perhaps civilians?
		What about the smell?
			Decomposition
		Could Troutlicker be the drake?
			Awful smell, something missing, we know the drake is afoot...
		Time to turn around
	Zaknos and Kiruka rejoin the group
		Reports on what they saw
		Others are doubtful that 
		Tetron knows the smell: hundreds of corpses on a battlefield
		Perhaps civvies left out of whatever happened?
		Viola proposes going to talk to them, offer to help, bug out if things are sus
		What about the horses?
			Perhaps the civvies can help?
	We approach
		We hear a scared old man and old woman, apologizing for being in the area
			They insist that they're not gathering wood
		They have a blond boy with them, holding rocks and leaves
		A middle-aged woman with a bandana with two baskets, standing defensively
		They have trout, wild mushrooms, and grasses
		Dude freaks out when Viola says that we're adventurers
			She has to clarify
		Tetron asks for info
			They don't harvest wood, on account of Lumber Consortium regulations
			They live in the Lattimer Mining Camp
			The men are away, on account of a labor dispute
			"Savages" took up residence in the mine
				Overseer Goyle went to help
			What's the smell? (Alistair)
				Civvies are relieved to hear a child speak
				The mines.  They dump bodies in the water.
					Viola tells Zaknos to stay away from fey
					This doesn't sit well with the civvies
		Middle aged woman is Clarice, her son is Rick; the other two are Clarice's parents
			Troutlicker is their cat
		Zaknos dismounts and tries to approach friendily
		Tetron asks them to not tell anyone that they saw us
			They are very obliged to do so
		Tetron asks what they're afraid of
			They start spouting Consortium propaganda
			Viola explains that we're no friends of the Consortium
		Zaknos's approach softens them a little
		Troutlicker arrives with a small fish
			Tetron prestidigitates the cat clean
			Rick picks up the cat in preparation for departure
		Tetron offers to let Sybil ride on his horse
			Krug has to pick her up
			Viola offers the same courtesy to Simon
At Lattimer Mining Camp (The Mill)
	The family is the Bilgers
	They put up the horses
	The homes are barebones; just what one needs to subsist
		No decor
		No anything
	We're let into their home
	They don't have enough places for everyone to sit
	Info dump
		Tetron asks whether the Overseer comes here often
			His home is here
		They're seen Marcellus
			He took the Overseer, the "disciplinarian" (Norris), and a half-dozen men who were still there with him
			That was two nights ago
	Alistair goes to look around the camp
		Troutlicker follows him out the door, but it just needs to piss
		Alistair goes to the overseer's office
	Viola asks what dangers lurk near the back
		They really don't want us to go that way
		"Demonic angels"
			They were attracted by the smell of the bodies
			They scavenge the bodies
			Tetron is aware of harpies
				But what's interesting is that harpies tend to live in caves where there is food, but the fact that they've been drawn out of the cave instead is weird
			They think they've sinned on account of the cycle of labor and death
	Tetron asks why they're still here
		Sybil and Simon's son works at the mine, and he's stayed alive this whole time
	At the overseer's office
		It's the only house that has a chimney
		Not as disparate in affluence as Kreed's was from the other homes in Falcon's Hollow
		One story, plus a loft
		Seems like no one's home
		Checking the door, no trap, picked open
		He's looking for documentation and valuables (go figure)
		Looks like it's used more for meetings than living
		Bedroom is the loft
		There's a desk up there
			Small stack of papers: each has a date, name, "crime" and a punishment
			Punishments are heavily disproportionate to the offenses
				Talking back, for instance
				He takes the lot (fifteen)
		Places where bags and weapons were stored, they are taken
		Looks like other people slept here a night
		Small chest: signet ring and wax seal kit
		8 gold in change laying around
	Alistair heads back
		Rick is approaching the cat with 
		The civvies think that something worse drove the harpies out of the cave
			Perhaps a sign from Asmodeus
			Viola assures them that those sorts of things are what we take care of
		As we leave, Zaknos sneaks around back to plant money for them to find
			Right next to where the cat peed
			20 gp
		Rick has the cat wave at us
Back into the woods
	Alistair scouts ahead
		He finds stone pillars jutting out from a stream
		Three harpies perched on top, trying to cover themselves from the rain
		He heads back to report
	Viola investigates as the party moves along
		The area is relatively untouched by the mining operation
		Large claw marks around, but not as much as expected
		Viola's harpy knowledge:
			They're probably about as strong as we are
			They're filthy
			Prefer simple melee weapons
			Fliers
			If they sing, you might become fascinated
			They can speak, but not entirely sure of language
	Tetron thinks about best ways to defeat harpies
		When harpies are nesting, they don't like to be approached, but they are more willing to negotiate than to fight
			Tread carefully; if negotiations fail, we fight to the death
	Viola approaches the harpies to negotiate
		"Good morning!"
		She introduces herself and asks to pass
		They aren't receptive, not wanting humans to be behind them
		Viola explains that we'd be just as much of a problem in front of them as we would behind them if we wanted to fight
			They consider this
		The leader explains that they want something in exchange: there is a creature that crawls on the walls
			It eats their food and kills their people
			One of their sisters is within, nesting eggs that are nearly ready to hatch
			If we promise to kill the creature, we may pass
			Viola agrees
		As we pass, the harpies warn about a trap left by the "streakers"
			Alistair finds a strip of nails beneath the surface of the water
				It may even close some kind of gate
				Disarmed successfully
				Pulling it out, he realizes that it wouldn't maim so much as cause copious bleeding
Into the cave
	The floor is water, too deep for Alistair and Nilbog to walk in
	Bodies floating all around
	There's a water-drenched harpy crouched on top of one of the highest outcroppings
		Viola wishes her a good morning and tells her that we're here to deal with the crawling creature
		She's pissed at her sisters; she's not moving until her egg hatches
	Alistair climbs onto one of the outcroppings
		It's kind of slippy up top
		Body rot, sludge, other gunk
		He can see other nests further in the room, but they only have bodies in them
		He looks for the creature
			Small passage past the harpy's nest that looks like an entry
		Tetron asks for a rope
			Grappling hook secured
			As he secures, he catches a glimpse of a creature with hair of matted seaweed
				Some kind of shark-like merperson?
			It spits a jet of water at Alistair
INITIATIVE
	First Round
		Nilbog casts guidance on Tetron and Viola, then fails to swim anywhere
		Alistair leaps down and attacks the creature, hitting twice
		The creature moves to retreat and fires on Alistair again, missing both times
		Zaknos tries to climb up one of the outcroppings and slips, cutting his hand
		Another creature emerges and approaches Zaknos to attack, hitting once
		Tetron climbs up the rope and fires a telekinetic projectile, missing because he can't see well enough
		Krug swims over to the rope and pulls Nilbog and himself onto the outcropping
		A third creature emerges and makes for the subterranean entrance, says that she's "doing it" and cranks open a gate
		Viola throws her knife to distract, throws again to hit one of the creature, then takes a defensive pose
	Second Round
		Horrendous whooping noise
		Nilbog casts Fireball against two of them (they take half damage), then casts guidance on Zaknos to help with the climbing
		Alistair swims toward the creature that shot him and attacks it again
			As she bleeds, she looks in fear back at the opening that her friend opened
		The first creature retreats and fires back at Alistair, hitting once
		Zaknos marks prey on the second creature, swims over to it, then misses a quick draw
		The second creature submerges
		Tetron casts light and carefully walks across the outcropping to move the light
		Krug jumps back down into the water and starts swimming toward the second creature
		The third creature swims over to attack Krug, critically hitting
		A large spike-backed creature emerges from the tunnel and swims straight for the outcropping where Tetron's standing
		Viola fails to find the submerged second creature, so instead she climbs the rope and then tries to distract the large creature with light reflected off her knife, but she can't quite get the angle
	Third round
		Nilbog heals Alistair, then casts shield
		Alistair attacks the big boy once and it glances off, and then he swims away and tries to climb a different pillar
		The first creature fires at Krug and Alistair, hitting Krug once and missing the other two shots
		Zaknos switches his prey to the big boi, puts away his sword, then quick draws his bow, donking off one of its spines
		The second creature surprises Krug, dragging him underwater, and it starts to drag him towards a place where bodies are tied down for drowning
		Tetron casts lightning bolt against big boy and creature 3, shocking them both, then moves behind Viola and Nilbog
		Krug struggles against creature 2, kicking away on the second try, and resurfaces
		The third creature moves up to attack Alistair, hitting once
		The large creature leaps out of the water onto the platform with Viola, Nilbog, and Viola, swiping at Viola and Nilbog, critting
		Viola tumbles past the big boy, takes out her rapier, then completely wiffs a finisher
	Fourth Round
		Nilbog heals Viola, completely restoring her, and then retreats, but he slips and falls prone
		Alistair swims up to creature 1 and attacks twice and hits once
		The first creature thrashes at Alistair, missing entirely
		Zaknos unleashes four shots and only hits once
		The second creature surfaces, then goes to flank Alistair, hitting once with its melee attack
		Tetron casts sleep against the big boy, which becomes asleep for the next minute, then he tries and fails to distract one of the creatures by throwing a rock
		Krug swims up to creature 3, rages, then bashes it with his shield
		The third creature moves to get in range of Tetron, then hits Tetron with two jets
		The big boy is asleep
		Viola flips over creature 3, hits a finisher, then misses a killing blow with her knife
