Sunday, early afternoon
	The Carved Chamber
		Tetron and Iris take seats at opposite ends of the chamber
		Tetron's centaur body necessitates moving a chair or two out of the way
		Tetron recognizes the tiefling seated in front of him
			And he recognizes Tetron
			Dude's a major anti-Eutropia advocate
				Skirted around getting directly implicated in treasonous activities during the War for the Crown, so he can still go about things freely
				Name: Colonel Stephan Malthus
		Tetron also recognizes an enby behind Iris
			Reputation as the right-hand of the person in charge of The Folds (Oppara's slums, aka The Scaffolds)
				M'aiq apparently doesn't recognize this person
					Likely on account of their typical form being different from their true appearance
						True appearance now
				Notes on The Folds: estimated 25% of Oppara's actual population; largely beneath the ground, like an anthill
			Name: Laji Baz
		Other traders afoot
			Also a butler
		First lot is brought in: Runes
			Inventory
				2 energy-absorbing
				2 moderate dread
				2 major paired
			Iris is interested in a major paired rune
				Tetron enters the two-way bid war at 2700
				And that's the final bid: Tetron wins
			No other runes bid upon by us
		Second lot is brought in: Weapons, presented by Sloane
			Inventory
				5th rank wand of mercy
				6th rank wand of mercy
				Siccatite cutlass
					Carved with stars and other celestial objects
						Doesn't appear to be affiliated with any significant deity
				Adamantine spear
				Tidal crossbow
				A quiver containing 3 greater starshot arrows
			None of them are especially interesting to us
				Looking at others bidding on them
					Col Malthas going for the starshot arrows
						Tetron starts counterbidding
							Malthas's moustache twitches, but he can't figure out who snipes him
						Tetron wins it: 1900 gp
		Third lot is brought in: Skilled/Artisan Slaves
			Several slaves' names are read out but not present: the Kaulfields'
				Why would they bulk-sell their slaves?
					Scenario 1: Downsizing/travelling
						Perhaps in prep for being stationed near the Andoren border?
			A blacksmith slave is fetching a decent bid war between the butler and a dwarf who hadn't bid on anything yet
				Old dwarf woman
				She has shimmery veins on her hands
					Indicative of work with ley lines during forging
				Dwarf ends up winning it
			Iris takes the opportunity to look at the leatherface guy
				Hasn't bid yet
				Has been watching Iris and Tetron
		Fourth lot is brought out: Socialite
			Inventory
				Curtain Call Cloak
				Moderate Wardrobe Stone
				Shadow Manse
				A set of Sarenraen beads
					It's intelligent and speaks
						He pleads to not be sold in this black market
			Baz and Malthus are bidding on the beads
			Butler and leatherface are bidding on the shadow manse
			Iris joins in on the beads - 1800
				Baz counters with 2k
				Malthus bows out
				Iris wins at 2100
					Tetron notices that Baz sees Iris
			Iris also goes for the Wardrobe Stone for Viola's sake
				Qadiran merchant bidding
				Iris jumps in at 1000
					That wins it
		Fifth lot is brought out: Business Utility
			Inventory
				Quill of Passage, uniquely modified to cast heightened Magic Passage
				Bring Me Near
				Major Sealing Chest
			Leatherface bids on the Quill of Passage
				Only bidder and wins
			Iris gets in on the Bring Me Near at 1200
				The dwarf doesn't respond, on account of having dropped 8k on the blacksmith
		Sixth lot is brought out: Prestigious Slave Lot
			Two individuals
			Intense bidding starts immediately
			Iris identifies the slave on the left as an astral deva of Iomedae
				Malthus is leading the intense bidding at 12k against Baz
				The deva's situation makes Iris severely uncomfortable, given Arazni's history, despite the animosity between her and Iomedae
				She offers a silent prayer for the deva: "despite who he serves, give this man the strength to overcome his bonds"
				Winning bid is 14k
			Tetron doesn't quite know what the slave on the right is
				Blue-skinned, elf-like, femme person covered in runes
					As little clothing as possible
					Some of the runes are binding, like the Kaulfields' slaves
				Leading bid is 10k, but Tetron jumps in at 10.1k for intel
					The Qadiran merchant responds at 11k
						But he's referencing a sheet of paper, like he is following directions
				Winning bid is 12k
			As the blue woman is led away, she looks up, through the ceiling, and her chains begin to shake before she is teleported
		Goblin announcer says that upcoming lot is the last
			Winners' goods will be given immediately upon exiting
			Winners' slaves will be handed over at secret locations or sent directly to a galley
		Final lot is brought out: Heritage pieces
			Inventory
				Armor made of lion's pelt: Grisantian Pelt Armor
					The lion is symbolic of Taldor
				Set of Communication Pendants
				Elder Fey of the Past
					She's floating within a glass enclosure, unconscious
			Bidding on the fey is swift among the merchants
				But it's not being run up super fast
			Pendants are being targeted by Baz and a tengu merchant
				Already up to 4k, so never mind
			Focus on the fey
				Iris and Tetron help push the bids straight through the 20k range and into the 30s
				Iris sees Malthus counter with 37k and responds with 40k
				Malthus relents at 45k, with Iris winning at 46k
		Closing remarks
	Payments and winnings
		Including the bag
	Meanwhile, with the others, heading to Greyguard
		Our explanation is sufficient to get the guards to summon Dupont
		Dupont looks haggard and weary as he waves us in through the gate
		Dupont's office is a mess
			We start to present our case
				Where is the rest of the party?
					Viola lies that they're in Almas
						Sending?
							Doesn't work
				He starts gathering others
		We're lead to the Admiralty Citadel
			We're stripped of weapons
			We're brought to Kasaba's office suite
				This interrupts a serious meeting
				She was being briefed on the Chelaxian invasion of Andoran intel
				A figure at the head of the table - teal with horns, long braids laid down her chest, holding a staff with gold dangly bits
					Draconic
					She smiles at us
				As we go to Kasaba's private chambers, Alistair asks Dupont who the draconic lady is
					Councilor to the crown, rarely leaves Oppara
				In Kasaba's office
					She pulls up a few mahogany chairs, pulls the curtains closed
					Room smells of cinnamon and vanilla
					Kasaba: Must be really important, what business do you have with me?
						Dupont plops the packet down on her desk before anyone has a chance to respond, then presses us to explain
					We give our full explanation, omitting extremely little
					Once we're finished, she pulls out a fancy scroll and explains that there is to be a tribunal tomorrow regarding the Priallas' and Vaylens' deaths
						The scroll was going to be the summons to testify about the Bains
						But these are irrelevant now, since we're going to be far more active in the proceedings
							She'll draft new summons
						Stuff like Ring of Truth will be employed
						Participation is not optional, and cooperation is the only way to keep ourselves in good standing
					Kasaba brings up Pierce
						Her execution will be stayed for at least the duration of the tribunal
						Any unjustly held people will be re-evaluated
					Kasaba turns to Dupont: You're acting chief constable now
					We have to stay in Cassomir
						Crossing over to Andoran side of town requires an escort, but is permitted
				We get our stuff back
				Our escort is a human woman of Ulfen heritage
					Name: Zara Godfrey
					Technically a contractor, but has been steady with Cassomir authorities for over a decade
	To Hosetter
		We hand over Chester's skull to Buracir
			Zenza is apparently prepping for rez
		We hand over the invasion plans
			Buracir says she's going to consult with her superiors regarding compensating us for this
		Buracir says that Patia wants to meet Iris for a ritual
		Hosetter suddenly springs to life as we leave
Let-out time (5 pm) at the Roaring Hall
	Iris and Tetron got the goods
	Viola got the cover story
		Iris is mad
	Viola tells Iris about Patia's meetup
	We head back to the Black Pit Tavern
		Skies darken with rain clouds
			Ominously dark
