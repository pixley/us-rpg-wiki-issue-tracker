Sunday, just before lunchtime
	At the goblin camp
		Jocnok and Ossa have left
		Checking in on the prisoners
			We start wheelbarrowing them away
	Alistair and guards reconvene with us along the way
		They see the dudes in the wheelbarrow
		Viola reports what happened
			She says that all the ones who didn't fight to the death fled
		They take the dudes in for help
	The cops take us in for questioning
		We show them the stolen pork
		They gave us lunch too
			Free sandwiches
Late afternoon now
	Reporting back to Greg Totters
		After a ton of debate, we take the 35 gp over 50 gp worth of meat
	Tetron and Nilbog back at the Hoyerts'
		Conversation over
		Tetron complains about it having been a waste of time; could have helped more
			Nilbog says that they had good intent
			Tetron makes his argument from a military strategy standpoint
		Nilbog suggests just chilling and drinking back at the inn
	At the inn (Birch Branch)
		It has middle-of-the-road ale
		The rest of us arrive
			Viola asks about the ritual
				She is sad now
		The owner comes over to us
			She recommends a natural spring to us - Velour Grotto
				It's a few blocks away in Gillmen's Moor
				We saw a quest posting for there
	To Velour Grotto
		We approach an unassuming building
			Has a fancy wooden sign that shows its name
				"With Everflowing Cavern"
			Front door is alarmingly large
				High enough that only Krug can reach the top of the door frame
			We can hear from the top floor sounds of conversation and enjoyment
				Viola asks whether we've given Alistair "The Talk"
			A large wooden clawed hand pushes the door aside
				A large tree with a large jar for a head greets us
				He hands Viola a flower grown from his finger
					He says it only lasts to the end of the day
				Viola asks for Good Sir Gordon
					That's him
					She says that we're here to help with the tight space thing
		We follow Gordon in and he sits on a couch, gesturing us to join him
			He insists that this is a fine establishment
				Sexual stuff and healing spas
				He's had two separate pest control folks come by, but only to limited success
				Something's been really tough to draw out
					Clients have been reporting "rat noises"
					They're still finding rat droppings
					Alarmingly, the ladies' underwear has been chewed at
			Tetron asks where the undergarments are kept when not in use
				Left on chaises and pillows and other decor
			Encounters can be long enough
			Also missing food
			Viola asks which side has been chewed at
				Both
				???
			Alistair asks: holes in the walls?
				No, patched over
				There are sceptic drains
			Viola asks: where does the food get gnawed at?
				In the rooms
				There are dumbwaiters
			Tetron asks to see the dumbwaiter system
		We are led into a narrow but tall kitchen
			Tetron asks where Gordon is from
				Arthfell
				Came to Almas because the water is nice
			He opens a flap and shows us the shaft
			Tetron asks whether there's been any issues in the spa
				No, thankfully
			Viola suggests that maybe we look around in one of the rooms
		He leads us to an unoccupied room
			Room decor is not quite tasteful
			Alistair verifies that the damage has occurred in this room
				Yes
			Alistair starts investigating
				Finds rat poo and a dildo under the bed
				He sticks his head into the dumbwaiter shaft
					The tray and ropes take most of the cross-sectional area
					He does see tiny footholds carved into the sides of the shaft
			Tetron tries detecting magic
				Nope
			Tetron asks whether any of the staff have skills beyond their employment
				Transformation, invisibility, etc
				Nope
				What about frequent clientele?
					They do see their fair share of uni students
					People of middle income sometimes come by, but can't say that they'd do magic
			Can Alistair fit into the shaft?
				Yes
			Alistair reports that he's found something weird and asks if he can climb in
				Gordon sticks (some of) his head in to ask for suspension of food delivery
				Gordon does mention that he requested two people because the target(s) is quite the escape artist
			Alistair climbs in
				He shimmies all the way to the top (third floor)
					He hears sex noises along the way
				Where the roofline would be, he sees a curve
					After considering that the lack of attacks would make it safe, he pokes his head up to look
					It's smaller, but he could shimmy through
					He sees a small pillow, an unlit candle, and bits of food
						There's also a pile of hole-punched pieces of underwear
					It also smells up here
			While Alistair is up there, Gordon talks up the reward
				"So much value"
				It heals wounds a bit
			Meanwhile, Alistair drops down and pokes his head out
				He reports the existence of a crawl space and the "nest there"
				Viola asks what the nest looked like
					She's stunned by the candle
			Tetron asks if they've treated for sprites
				No, he'd be happy to have a fey roommate
			But what about the rat poo?
				Maybe it isn't rat poo
				Alistair points to the bed
				Zaknos takes a look
					He's confident it's rodent poo
			Tetron considers what sort of creature fits the bill
				In the Taldan Army, it was convenient for druids to scout in animal form
				That'd be the only sentient creature he can think of that'd
			Tetron asks any of the clientele are druids
				Not that Gordon knows of
			How to address that possibility?
				Viola suggests that they make a trap
				Krug suggests a trap made of underwear
				Viola suggests that it could be laced with some kind of sleeping agent
				Gordon does indicate that the underwear would need to be used
					Viola says nothing
					He can go get some, though
			Gordon likes the idea
				We'd need to return after a client comes by, like at night or something
				Viola offers our contact info
				As she's writing it, Tetron suggests that we just chill at the spa instead
					Gordon's into that, and we can just have that counted as part of the reward
						And if it doesn't work, we just pay on the way out
			Gordon takes us to the Everflowing Cavern
				We get 3 hours
				He points out the flowers
					They're from some kind of evil leshy thing, but they're safe
					Viola advises that he never tell people that
				There's a statue face among the tree roots
					Viola recognizes it: it's Alseta
					Is this a portal?
						We start looking for a place to put "eggs"
				Alistair tests the depth: about 6 feet
					He also looks for stuff people dropped
						A few coins
					What about druid stuff?
						Nope
				Tetron tries to make a potion out of it
					He doesn't really get a good sense of what is going on
						It changes color
					He pours it out, and the water turns back to the original color
				Tetron wonders if the flowers are safe to pluck
					Probably fine, but it would probably die quickly and lose efficacy
				Alistair climbs up onto the statue/tree
					He finds moss and stuff
					Any hollows?
						Lots
					Krug asks if he found treasure
						Nope
				Tetron studies the face
					He notices that, toward the top of her antler-like things, the tree is drying out
					Viola grabs a towel and goes to get a closer look
						There are areas of the tree above that are still verdant
						She pushes at the dry branches, but they don't move
				Alistair splashes at Nilbog, who is sitting at the edge
					"It only takes an inch or two to drown."
					Viola quips that he's wearing the safety vest
				Alistair uses Spout to shoot water at the dry wood
					It doesn't seem to have an effect
			Later, we hear Gordon coming
				He says he has good news
				We come out
					Viola prestidigitates Krug dry
				Alistair asks what the deal with the face is
					It grew naturally like that
					Gordon says that it's also found in the Verduran and Arthfell
					Alistair asks whether they all have faces
						No
					Alistair mentions that the face is drying out
						He's looked at it
						Hasn't been able to help
						It's been like this for 10 years
							Viola asks if it's gotten substantially worse in the past month
								YES
								Viola explains that we're fighting enemies of Alseta
									Gordon tells us to punch them for him
			Alistair climbs back up
				He finds a sleeping naked humanoid man
					He can see only part of the face - thin nose, saggy old person skin texture, has a rat-looking face
					His butt is covered in poo and his penis is out
					He's the size of a halfling
						And he's taking up the entire width of the passage
				He climbs back down and reports
					Gordon is astonished
					Krug asks if we could use a rope
					Alistair gets out a rope to tie his feet
					Viola suggests using the lift tray to keep him from falling 30 feet
					Krug provides the manpower
			We have the guy
				He's ugly as shit
				Viola jogs to the police
					She now has to explain what "special kind of pervert" means
				Viola and cops return
					They're disgusted
					They take him away, wrapping him in a sheet
					Tetron warns them about the transformation
						They'll take him to anti-magic jail
				Gordon gives us the tokens
					And two extra (Viola and Alistair)
					And he offers a discount for brothel services
				Tetron suggests dinner
					Viola says that she'd like to wait, on account of the disgusting preceding events
				Alistair asks where Viola got her armor runes
					She tells him
			After leaving the Velour Grotto
				Alistair goes to get runes
				Tetron decides to go shopping
					Others follow
Evening
	Alistair buys an aeon stone from the IMG
	Tetron tries to make income by tutoring university students in magic
		Success: 2 gp, 5 sp
		AND... as he's tutoring
			He hears from a back lab, a slight sound
				Choking?
				He stands up to investigate
				Door's closed, sound's louder
				He shouts, "is everything okay in there?"
					Voice from within says yes
				Tetron opens the door anyway
				Three people, one sitting
					One standing person, holding down the sitting person
					The other standing person is force-feeding some kind of slime
					The sitting person is choking
					"It's just a prank, bro!"
					Tetron casts tanglefoot to stop the activity
					Sitting guy is ginger, nearly unconscious, spitting up the slime
					Tetron sends Taranis to relay the appearances and activities of the students
					Students make a run for it
						They're too tanglefooted
					Choking kid is trying to heimlich himself
						Tetron helps instead
						A living slime pops out
							It tries to flee
							One of the students try to recapture it, but Tetron telekinetic projectiles the jar to himself
							Tetron captures the slime himself
					Tetron tells the assholes to piss off
					Tetron checks on the hazing victim
						He was told that there was "something cool" to see, but he had to drink the slime first
							The "cool thing" was a hot girl who always keeps her windows open
					Tetron inspects the slime
						It's clinking against the glass
						He takes it along
			Taranis reports back, success
		To the library to learn about slimes
			Determines that the slime was recently brewed
			Likely has to be fed organic matter or magical items
				Prefers flesh
			As it's fed, it grows
			Tetron asks Taranis to find a mouse or something to feed the slime
	Viola buys a five-feather wreath
	Reconvene at the inn to chat
		Tetron shows off the slime
			He's considering naming it "Goober"
		Taranis returns with a headless vole
			He drops it in a jar
			It dissolves within a minute
		Alistair suggests that it could be used to dispose as evidence
			Tetron admits that he had thought of that
		What's for dinner?
			Tetron suggests crab legs
	Crab Legs!
		Tetron feeds the shells to Goober
			Server gives Krug and Nilbog a weird look over the missing shells
		Zaknos wants to chat
			He apologizes for taking the goblin kid hostage
				Apology accepted
		Tetron orders beer to feed to Goober
			It sits on top for a bit, then fizzles down
			No visible change
		Zaknos buys beer too
			He pours some onto Goober too
		With the jar open, Goober pokes a bit of itself above the lip of the jar
	Bedtime now
		Tetron goes into his trance to learn a spell
			Mirror Tetron is chilling in there too
				Asks specifics about the day
					Generally truthful
				Also asks about personal info
					Keeps things broad
			He learns another too
			Learned deafness and see invisibility
		Alistair asks Taranis if he'd go get more food for Goober
			No
Moonday morning
	We awake to rain pittering on our windows
	Knock at the door
		Claims to have a "check"
		Viola answers to receive
		It's from the Lumber Consortium!
			100 gp
	Have to visit the Church of Abadar
		In Liberty
		Cashing the check!
		We see a wealthy couple also cashing a check
			Zaknos and Tetron try to listen in
			Dude with beard and brown hair: "Cash to the name of Roger Macera"
			Lady: "Oh could be under Luther's name"
			Teller reports that it's under Luther and hands over an obscene amount of money
				All the money gets shovelled into her purse (which must be extradimensional)
			They leave, saying that Margot's waiting for them
			Zaknos follows them outside
				He just takes note of which direction they went
				And then he sits on the curb
	As we come out, Zaknos reports what he heard
		Nothing really interesting out of that
	What now?
		Tetron has a meeting with his college buddies tonight
		Alistair has to pick up his armor
		Then we can talk to Kuktun
		Then maybe go look into the magical surprise quest
	Alistair picks up his armor
	Cerulean Keep
		As we enter, the catfolk we talked to before pulls us aside
			She's really confused by the ID and how old it is
			Especially under Timberfell
			There were old Taldan barracks that were flooded out a long time ago, and that's where it would have come from
				The Rending, a volcanic eruption, caused the Andoshen to flood and cover the Almas of the time in sediment
			She wants to send a group of soldiers to investigate
				Tetron mentions that the flooding component could have some connection to the creature we fought
		We meet Varuk there, their hair freshly braided
			They knew Kuktun when they were younger
		We're taken through security
			Zaknos is stopped for a search, as they detect some kind of bad energy about him
				They get a blip of diabolic energy on Zaknos's chest
				Zaknos starts making a scene about being discriminated against
					He tries to use it as a distraction to pass Chimpy's token over to Nilbog
						It works
						None of the rest of us even notice
							Except Varuk, but they don't know what that was about
				They scan him again
					"I knew it!"
		Onto Kuktun
			Tetron asks what that was all about
				Zaknos admits to him what happened
			Knock on the door
				Jolly voice greets us
			We enter
				Dude's smiling, wearing underarmor
				Hugs Varuk
			He says that Varuk told him about the help we needed
				The basics
			Varuk takes their leave
			Kuktun asks for the whole story from us
				Zaknos tells him everything except for Chimpy's preference
			Kuktun's response
				He, of course, will help as the favor to Varuk
				He might be able to get a small bit of help from his squad
					Have to be volunteers
			How are we breaking the contract?
				By combat?
					Viola suggests that if the company didn't exist anymore, the contract can't be enforced
				By negotiation?
					Maybe?  Dunno.
				A combination of the two?
					Could, but would have to lead with negotiation, since hostility would instantly ruin that approach
					But how would we even negotiate?
						Viola says that we've had the smartest people we know look at it, and we haven't found a good way to get out of it
						Kuktun points to the contract: There is the Termination section (6)
							We could get them to want to break it, and they would have to give money over
							Viola retorts: getting them to break it wouldn't prevent them from hiring someone else
							Krug: How to get them to want to break it anyway?
								If managing him seems cumbersome...
								Skirting around the rules...
								However, they're probably more likely to retaliate for transgressions
								Tetron suggests: Zaknos is super incompetent, they might want to bail for that alone
				Zaknos asks Nilbog to go get some water (to get Chimpy out of hearing range)
					Alistair volunteers instead, but Tetron shoots him down
				Viola asks where we're even fight as a trap?
					Can't summon them into a good-aligned place
					Need to scope out a place
					What about Chimpy?
						Doing something so chaotic good would pop him like a balloon
