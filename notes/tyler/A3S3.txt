[Notes from COVID session; reconstructed with the help of Josh's summary and consultation with Luyou]
Moonday afternoon
	Party minus Tetron chatting in Zaknos's room
		Viola suggests paying Tetron back for the burned book
			Cites Krug's point about it not potentially being Tetron's fault
			Nilbog isn't particularly on-board
				He's full-on distrustful of Tetron at this point
				He doesn't trust Tetron to use the money in an appropriate manner
			Alternative suggested: Buy Tetron a new spellbook ourselves in Almas
				Nilbog is more comfortable with that idea
		Who should apologize to Tetron?
			Krug volunteers
			Viola tags along
	Tetron's room
		Krug knocks and asks to be let in to talk
			Viola comes in behind, hat in her hands
		Krug and Viola apologize on behalf of the party for the book situation getting out of hand
		They relay the offer to purchase a new one
			Tetron quips about how it would be "approved material"
				Krug confirms that
		Krug explains Nilbog's vision, and that it's possible that Tetron himself is cursed, since it doesn't seem like the book was
			Tetron finds it hard to believe that they'd just go off of Nilbog's word for that
		Viola emphasizes that Tetron is part of the team, and they want to work together to resolve the situation
			Tetron expresses surprise that he's still allowed to be part of the Radiant Dawn
		Krug and Viola leave
	Party assembles for late lunch
		It's a little awkward between Tetron and the rest of the table, but things are civil
		Zaknos laments not having bread to make his lunch into a sandwich
			Tetron *prestidigitates* some "bread", which has no taste or structural integrity, but Zaknos eats it like that anyway
	Viola resumes sewing
	In Krug and Nilbog's room
		Nilbog asks Krug who can be redeemed
			"Everyone"
		Krug asks who Nilbog is talking about
			A dwarf
		What did he do?
			Exist
			Krug explains that merely existing isn't a bad thing
				You have to *do* something bad to need to redemption
		Nilbog insists that dwarves are inherently bad
			Krug tries to angle it from the point that producing a new life isn't a bad thing
			Nilbog interprets it as dwarf parents being bad for having created a new dwarf
		Nilbog expresses feeling conflicted because the cook helped him, so he thinks that he should try to redeem him in return
			Krug insists that that isn't necessary
	Alistair knocks on Tetron's door
		Even though everyone else is on the "approved reading" train, Alistair understands that Tetron would rather not have that constraint
		He offers to help Tetron procure a new illicit spellbook and to help hide it
		Tetron says that he'll consider it
	Up on the main deck
		Tetron and Alistair entertain themselves with casting cantrips off the side of the ship
Evening
	Tetron chooses to eat with Nilus rather than the party
		Nilus's goings on
			Nilus switched from alchemy to natural studies
				Feels more apt at it due to being a catfolk
				Didn't like his alchemy professor anyway
					Green-haired (fading) gnome, might be leaving the school soon
				The reason he's on the trip is that he serves a guide on account of his new field
					Able to forage for food and such
						Why not just use magic?
							Might not always have access.
		Other folks from the university
			Namira and Cyrus
				Tetron is implied to have been romantically involved with Cyrus
					Light ribbing by Nilus
					Tetron had thought the relationship had been under wraps
				Namira had mostly been in Andoran
				Cyrus had mostly been in Taldor
		The Radiant Dawn being kind of weird
			Taking a whole group wouldn't be a great idea
			Tetron goes to bat for us
				We're competent
				Zaknos... not so much
			Could one of the party be useful?
				Someone Tetron considers a friend or ally...
					He considers Viola and Alistair
					He immediately eliminates Viola on account of her loud presence
			Alistair overhears the conversation and interjects a snarky comment
			Tetron invites Nilus to have breakfast with the full group to get to know us
				Nilus accepts
	Zaknos goes up to the cook
		Volunteers to introduce sandwiches to the menu
		Cook isn't totally on-board
			Bread costs money to make
		Zaknos accepts paying to have the bread made and to do the sandwich prep
		Nilus sees this
	Game night with the Olgirs!
		Amos orders shots for everyone who wants one
		We play a game where we draw from a deck of cards and have to tell a story based on the suit drawn
			Categories are: love, loss, gain, pain
			Goal is for Amos to get to know us better
			Tetron tells the story of how he gained some amount of status by way of being part of a LAP
			Zaknos tells the story of his crush on his next door neighbor's mom
				Stacy's mom had it going on
				She was kind of bitch, though; Amos didn't like her
			Alistair tells the story of how he got super sick one time
			Krug tells the story of how he had made friends among the Knights of Lastwall, but they got separated and couldn't find them again after that
			Nilbog tells the story of his chieftain bravely fought against dwarves
			Viola tells the story of how Sabrina Pierce inspired her
		Poker afterward
			We play just for fun, using Amos's money as tokens
			Viola makes it her goal to win with the worst cards, but she's only moderately successful
				She lets Fleche in on the shenanigans
			Amos gets cleaned out bad
	Tetron goes to bed and dreams
		He feels himself laying on a non-bed surface with someone leaning over him
			The person clears his throat to get Tetron's attention
		Tetron opens his eyes
			He's in a liminal space
			A copy of himself is next to him
		Tetron grabs out at the duplicate
			Where he touches, the facade flickers, revealing the doppelganger skin beneath
		Mirror Tetron apologizes for the commotion that day
			He had let things get way out of hand
			He shouldn't have taken over without asking
			Implicit admission to being the reason for Tetron's gaps in consciousness/memory
		Mirror Tetron insists that he can be useful to Tetron
			He just wants exposure to the outside world
				Other people
				Interesting items
			He's willing to let Tetron set the terms
			One more thing: he can recreate the destroyed book in here
		Tetron considers the offer and sets his terms
			Mirror Tetron only comes out when Tetron permits it
			Tetron gets to use the liminal space to study things secretly
			Tetron guides Mirror Tetron through learning to be social
				Being trapped for 1000 years has made Mirror Tetron awkward and anxious
		The deal is agreed upon
		Tetron studies the recreated book and learns more spells
Morning of Full Day 2 of Sailing
	Breakfast
		No Tetron; he's sleeping in
		No Zaknos; he's making sandwiches
		Nilus approaches, asking where Tetron is
			Viola says he's sleeping in
			We had a late night
		Nilus asks to join us
			We welcome him
		Nilus asks what we're about
			Viola brags about saving the people of Falcon's Hollow and capturing Tessra
			What are we doing now?
				Viola deflects by saying that we're doing a gov't job
				Nilus takes this to mean that we're gov't employees
					Viola clarifies by saying that we're mercenaries contracted for the time being
			We talk about our roles within the party
		Nilus asks about Tetron: how he fits into the party dynamic
			Viola explains that she and Tetron have something of a contentious relationship due to differing worldviews
	Alistair plays with Fleche
		Teaches her how to be the best at Hide-and-Seek
	Viola continues sewing
	Nilbog gets a coal for comfort
		Decides to carve it into a Sarenraen icon
		He succeeds
	Tetron wakes up, finds Nilus, and apologizes for missing breakfast
		He blames the alcohol from game night
		He suggests that they do lunch instead moving forward
Evening
	Viola skips out on game night to spend the evening listening to Mirabel's performance
		Mirabel invites her to join in
		Viola has Mirabel lay down a base-line harmony, and then she improvises over it
		It goes decently well, though not to Viola's standards
	Game night 2: Alice does Tarot readings
		Tetron got The World reversed, representing a lack of completeness
		Nilbog got The Chariot upright, representing willpower and resolve
		Krug got The Wheel of Fortune reversed, representing something about himself that he can't accept
		Alistair got The Emperor upright, representing father figures
		Zaknos got Strength upright, representing inner strength and bravery
		Amos got inverse Temperance: excess, lack of balance
	Bedtime
		Nilbog has a nightmare
			It's past sundown, and the rest of the party hasn't returned from the dive
			The sailors are just about to give up for the night
			Nilbog pleads for them to go look
			One-by-one, the sailor jump into the water with no splash and disappear
			Panicking, Nilbog peers into the water
				He sees everyone lifelessly looking back up at him, hundreds of feet below
Morning of Full Day 3 of sailing
	Tetron sleeps in to learn more spells
	Zaknos continues to contribute sandwiches to breakfast
	Viola continues sewing
		Alice tells Viola how much she appreciates her being kind to Fleche
			She mentions that Fleche wants Viola to tell her a bedtime story
				Viola would be honored
		Alice offers to do a make-up Tarot reading for Viola
			Viola draws The High Priestess reversed, representing lack of center and represessed feelings
	After Tetron wakes up, he takes Fleche (Amos too) on-deck to demonstrate spellcasting
	Nilbog attempts to make two more icons out of coals, he fails
	At the end of the afternoon, Viola finishes her new outfit
Evening
	Game night 3: Fleche wants to know what the most powerful thing each member of the Radiant Dawn could defeat is
		Viola says that she could take the giant automaton from the LAP trial by herself
		Nilbog says he could take anything, because there's always a chance
			Viola asks if that includes Krug
				It does
		Krug, Tetron, and Alistair's responses... [I dunno]
		Zaknos straight-up lies about having defeated [something] himself
			The party did that together
			He gets stank looks from Viola (and maybe others)
			No one says anything because Fleche is having a good time
	Bedtime
		Alistair has a nightmare
			He's on a rooftop looking out over a mansion where a job is going down
			He knows what's going to happen, so he whistles the alarm
			His group scatters, and he makes a run for it
			He sees some of his team get caught by the police
			The prisoners are executed on the spot
				They're the other members of the Radiant Dawn
Final Day of sailing
	Viola and Krug get some air on-deck
		Viola doing stretches
	Alistair gets to hang out in the crow's nest
		Because he's been hanging out with Kosoko so much, the sailors are cool with him
	Zaknos's last time making sandwiches
	Nilbog gives the one good coal icon to the cook
		Some kind of progress toward not being racist
	We arrive
		The captain points out POIs as we sail into the city
