	After combat
		Tetron uses his staff to heal Viola and Krug
		Krug and Viola move the remains of construct 1 onto the button
		Alistair goes back into the fog and searches for traps
			Finds a tile with a faint crystalline pattern
				Magically analyzing it, it looks to be a summoning trap
			Discovers that the upper platform on the room is a large hidden spike pit
				Triggered by pressure
					So Alistair won't trigger it
				Sounds like it drops pretty damn low
		Krug, Tetron, and Viola load construct 2's remains (12 bulk) into Tetron's bag of holding
		Alistair finds a second pedestal past the spike pit
			Then crosses back over to go up the other stairs on the side of the large room, finding a small hallway
			Then he reports back
				Viola suggests that Alistair take Tetron's bag
				Tetron wants to take a look at the tile
		Alistair deposits the rocks
			Clears the fog in that room
		Tetron inspects the tile
			It's not a compression thing
			Instead seems to be a point where something happens when some other condition is met
			He heads back
		Alistair checks the hall beyond the second pedestal room
			The other end of the hall appears to be where the fog is coming from, and it's very dense
				Entering the room beyond will hurt even if Alistair holds his breath
			He heads back
		Report back
			Tetron figures that the tile summons the "crystal mage" when the buttons are all pressed
			Alistair reports the thick gas
		Into the fog
			Tetron and Krug step onto the spike pit and fall in
				Tetron gets fucked up and is dying 2
				Krug LoHs Tetron
					Tetron is wounded 1
	INITIATIVE
		Round 1
			Iris uses her winged boots to fly over the pit
			Alistair pulls out his ropes and throws them to Iris
			Viola runs, jumps across the pit, then pulls herself up onto the stairs
			Krug delays
			Tetron delays
				Tetron has 3 rounds of air remaining
		Round 2
			Iris lets down both ropes and secures them
			Krug takes the ropes, tying them to himself and Tetron (regular and climbing, respectively), then starts climbing back up (15/50)
			Tetron climbs with the assistance of the rope (which is needed) (35/50)
			Alistair moves to fresh air
			Viola moves to fresh air
		Round 3
			Iris flies over to Tetron, grabs him, then flies him over to the stairs
			Krug finishes climbing out
				Krug has 5 rounds of air remaining
	Safe room
		Iris has to catch Krug as he fails to catch the ledge
		Tetron smacks Alistair
			Alistair stammers out a lie of not having noticed the trap
				Tetron catches this and realizes that this was part of the trial
		How to deal with the thick fog
			Maybe go down the secret passage in the other hall instead
				Iris flies over and Alistair jumps over
			Iris notices that the walls can compress
				She knocks on the wall to signal Alistair
					She mouths that the hall is trapped
				They look and see that the mechanism is weight-based, and neither would trigger it anyway
			There's an illusory wall past the trap
				Inside is a third pedestal
					Iris alights onto it
						A click is heard
						All the smoke dissipates
		The crystal mage appears in the big room
			She goes down the lower hall and picks up a geode
			She finds Alistair and tells him that our secondary objective is to escort her and the geode to the end of the dungeon
		The crystal mage says that we can move on, but the adverse weather takes effect as soon as the door opens
			We can't come back
			Healing prep
				Alistair heals Krug
				Krug heals Viola
				Krug LoHs Tetron
			Alistair feels a slight tug coming from the next room
Steadfast Chasm
	The chamber is a massive canyon, crossed by several bridges at various heights
	There's an air elemental on our bridge
	Vents at the top of the ceiling
	Wind is currently blowing to the west
	Chasm is bottomless
	INITIATIVE
		Round 1
			Viola sprints and narrowly jumps across the broken portion of the bridge
			Alistair casts Warp Step to join Viola, then hops across the gap
			Living hurricane blows Viola back (Alistair resists), then moves to get between Viola and Alistair, covering the gap
			Iris establishes personal antithesis, recommends that Krug not step on the bridge, then moves to join Viola
			Tetron moves up, then considers the elemental
				Immune to bleed, poison, paralysis, sleep
				No weaknesses or resistances
				Very reflexive
			Krug goes out a ways onto the bridge, evaluates where the risky steps are, then moves into glimpse range with Viola and Iris
				The whole bridge won't collapse at once
			Crystal mage walks out onto the bridge
				Krug shouts at her to stop
			Wind shifts to blow south
			Call of the void claims Viola
				She grabs the edge
		Round 2
			Viola climbs back onto the bridge, feints against the elemental (success), then takes her defensive stance
			Alistair casts Warp Step again to retreat to the other side of the bridge, then pulls his bow out
			Living hurricane buffets Viola, Iris, and Krug (crit success, success, success) with wind, then backs away from the group
			Iris orders the crystal mage back, runs under the elemental, intensifies vulnerability, then stabs (crit)
			Tetron moves forward and casts Levitate on Krug
			Krug charges past the hurricane and slashes it on the way by (miss), then raises his shield
			Crystal mage retreats
			Wind stays southward
			Call of the void doesn't claim anyone
		Round 3
			Viola flanks the elemental with Krug, scores a finisher, and then fails a feint
			Alistair shoots at the elemental (hit, hit, miss)
			Living hurricane moves to cover Viola, then unleashes a burst to try to break the bridge, but it manages to stay together
				Any additional weight will cause the bridge to collapse
			Iris intensifies, then stabs (crit), killing the elemental
	Post-encounter
		Wind dies down
		Krug uses his levitate to get the geode across safely
		Alistair tries and fails to dislodge one of the crystals from the wall
		Krug requests a breather
			Krug LoHs himself
			Krug heals Iris
		Alistair tries again and succeeds
			Can be crushed and purified to make teleportation gates (but you need a lot of it)
Vault of Ratification
	Two adjoining chambers
		First filled with at least a dozen mirrors
			Purple ghoulish spirits flit in and out of the mirrors
		Second is an altar room
			Crystalline dragon and a humanoid
	INITIATIVE
		Round 1
			Spirits enter mirrors
			Viola moves to a corner and stabs the two mirrors there
			Dragon shoots a dazzling burst at the group (Tetron saves), then tries to demoralize Tetron
				Alistair, Iris, and Krug are dazzled
				Tetron is frightened 1
			Tetron analyzes the crystal thing in the middle of the room, then casts Haste on Viola
				Crystal golem, weak to bludgeoning, mindless
				Tetron is no longer frightened
			Humanoid moves to the archway separating the two chambers and gazes at Viola (she saves)
			Iris looks into the mirrors to find the spirits, but she can't see through the dazzling for a moment, but she finds one at the opposite end of the room (she tells Alistair), then moves out of the cluster of party members
			Krug engages the glass golem, takes his shield in two hands, then bops it
			Alistair shoots the mirror Iris identified, fails to find another spirit, then moves to get out of LOS of the dragon
			Glass golem swings at Krug (miss, miss, miss)
		Round 2
			Spirits turn up the brightness
			Viola breaks two more mirrors
			Dragon casts a spell: Four motes of dancing light further illuminate the room, then it burrows
				Iris and Krug are blinded
			Tetron finds a spirit and then sprays magic missiles
				This dims the room a bit as one spirit
			Humanoid approaches, then gazes at both Tetron and Alistair (both save)
			Iris moves away from the dancing light, looks for the final spirit, finds it, then exploits vulnerability against the humanoid
				Immune to paralysis, petrification, visual
				Resists physical
				Weakness to cold iron
			Krug moves away from the light and approaches the humanoid, then punches her (hit, miss)
			Alistair shoots the last mirror (miss, hit), then shoots the humanoid (crit)
			Glass golem approaches Viola, swings at her (crit and glimpsed, crit miss and riposted)
		Round 3
