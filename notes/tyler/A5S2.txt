Oathday, early afternoon
	Aegis Coalition hideout beneath Cassomir
		Tetron picks up a stool leg, the only piece of furniture that remains after the dimensional flux
			It's decorative, but mundane
		What now?
			Viola: I'm pretty beat up
			Tetron: We should go back
			Iris: We should debrief with Borgon
				Borgon starts his way out of Tetron's robes
				Tetron: We should talk back at the inn
		Alice: What's the plan?
			Tetron: Have you had lunch?
				Yes...
				I doubt you've had anything decent to eat in a while
				Iris: Okay, where?
	Out of the tunnels
		Fleche notices Iris covered in blood
		We prestidigitate before getting back onto the street
		Food: We end up at the Tremont Inn
			Known for rotisserie chicken and gravy
				Their special for today is poscacci chicken
					Which is not chicken - it's a pork cutlet
					And also borgabam roll
			We push two tables together
			Alice asks how we found the location, given how obscure it is
				Iris, Tetron, Viola: Borgon
					Alice: You found Borgon?!
			Iris introduces herself to Alice and Fleche
				Iris mentions that Zaknos and Nilbog retired and she filled the gap
					Viola explains that we were able to recover them from Zaknos's dad
				Iris invites them to stay with us
					Apparently, the Black Pit Tavern is a chain
			Iris feels one of the keys on Cheliff's keyring move
				As though it rotated to unlock something
			Tetron asks about Fleche's education
				Viola and Alice explain the incompatibility between travelling lifestyle and standard education
				Iris voices her distaste toward education
					Viola: Yeah, you grew up in Propagandaville
			Iris complains about the tension
				Tetron: Should we take it to go?
					Viola: Please let's eat in a proper environment for it
			Food arrives
	To the Black Pit Tavern
		We come across someone leaned up against a wall
			Tall thin male catfolk in Andoren blues
			Viola approaches: You wouldn't happen to be looking for the Radiant Dawn?
				Yes!  How?
			Dude's message: Please come see Lt Col Buracir
				Sure, once we get the Olgir's sorted
		Tetron recommends that maybe the Olgirs stay on the Andoren side
	West Cassomir
		Alice and Fleche post up at the buff maid's inn
		We're whisked into Buracir's office as soon as we get to Hosetter
			She asks a favor of us
				It's regarding the Bains
				She has on good authority that the Taldan's are assembling a pursuit immediately
					To leave this evening
					She wants us to be on that ship
				We discuss among ourselves for a bit
					Pierce and Kaulfields are the only super time-sensitive thing
					Viola: Pierce is due to be executed on Starday
					Iris: Alistair has the box, so not worried about the Kaulfields leaving soon
				Call Buracir back in
					Staying Pierce's executing would be Cheliff's domain
						About that...
						Buracir is aghast
							Lots of arguing about how to handle that
					Okay, back to the matter of the Bains
						Background about the Dragonfen
							Lots of beasts afoot
								Big unmanuverable ship could be a liability
						Iris: Do they have an accurate indication of the Bains' location?
						Iris: Do the Taldans want us specifically?
							Just a suggestion
						Tetron: Could you get us clearance to reenter the Bain mansion?
							Better way to get info on where they went
							Buracir: Maybe...
					Viola: But seriously, though, how do we coordinate with Taldan authorities without the Constable's death known?
						More arguing
				Buracir makes an aside to Alistair
					She compliments his blades and shows him one of hers: a knife of elven make (elfinra), rare
						She offers to trade
							Alistair acknowledges his dragon dagger and says that he got it too recently
								From the Bains
						She pulls out another, allegedly made by a legendary scholar
							He still declines
				Buracir: So, what's the conclusion
					Viola: Ambassadors don't get paid enough
					Tetron: Go on ahead, just leave out the location
			Left alone in Buracir's office
				Alistair complains about not being allowed to just forge Cheliff's signature or something
				Alistair pulls out the page that Alice grabbed
					The page is damaged, but Tetron doesn't have Ghost of Lost Works prepared right now
					The handwriting looks awfully similar to Alistair's
					Tetron reallocates spells to have Sending ready
			Buracir returns after an hour
				She has the catfolk from earlier with her
					But he remains outside
				She's gritting her teeth, closes the door, and sits down
				Unballing her fists, she gives the news
					The people arranging the expedition do not have direct ties to Cheliff
					She had difficulty pushing back Pierce's execution without giving a legitimate reason
						Pending Cheliff's return, one would need to speak to her immediate subordinate in Greyguard Castle
					No motion on the Bain Manor entry
				If we find ourselves in light political trouble moving forward, she offers assistance
				Before we go, she asks us for our thoughts on Zenza's son (the catfolk who summoned us)
					Unanimous: he was fine
					Viola: a little nervous
	Buracir walks us to the Steelcross Bridge, when directly connects Hosetter's area with Greyguard's
		Tetron asks Viola to take point in making the negotiations
		We're led by a dwarven guard into Greyguard Castle
	Greyguard Castle
		We're led to the officer's quarters, into a small office
		The guard knocks, then fucks off before the door even opens
		The door opens to a white-furred ratfolk
			Introduces himself as Deputy Stilton Duport
			We're let in
			His office is more nicely decorated than Cheliff's
		Successfully negotiate entry to the mansion, but under Duport's supervision
	To Bain Manor
		Duport explains that this is his first desk job, previously a pilot on one of the airships
		Split:
			Tetron, Iris, and Duport upstairs
			Viola, Alistair, and Krug downstairs
		Upstairs
			Tetron mentions the Lamashtu angle while Iris secretly looks for anything regarding the puzzle box
				Iris finds correspondence from the Kaulfields about the box
					Just hang onto it
		Basement
			The orb is gone... shit
			Viola: Look busy, I guess
			Krug looks for any changes to Kyphon's mechanism
				Something broke the tank from above, but that's it
		Back upstairs
			Duport complains about the gaudiness of the Lamashtu tapestry
		Reconvene
			Viola: Mission accomplished!
			Get to the TAS Flinthawk by 7 (it's 5 now)
	Back outside
		Viola: I need to shoot my shot to talk to Pierce
		Tetron's got a Ghost of Dead Works ready, so the others head back to the room
	Black Pit Tavern
		Everyone (except Viola) gets to see Iris's renovation
			Tetron hates it
		Borgon: So I'm chilling here during the dragon thing, yes?
			Tetron: Please come with.  You wouldn't want us to charge into this without your guidance, would you?
		Tetron casts Ghost of Dead Works on the Alistair Page
	Viola heads to the prison
		She follows him into Greyguard Castle
		He asks about the prison visit request
			Viola claims that she needs to talk to Pierce pursuant to another investigation
		Brought to a thick metal door beneath the castle
			Duport explains that this is where those awaiting execution are held
		The interrogation is held in a separate room from the cells
			Pierce is chained to a table
			Duport asks to stay in the room
				Viola tries to claim political reasons for privacy, but has to resort to admitting personal history
			Pierce doesn't speak or even meet Viola's gaze
			Viola gives Arnault's tidings
				No response
			Viola offers to prove her innocence
				Introduces herself and presents the Flying Heron
					She responds to that
			Her side of the story
				She was giving information about Andoren affairs to someone in Cheliax, but not the government, a businessman
				But Taldor's charges are more serious: she killed a member of House Karthis
					During the War for the Crown, she was given orders that turned out to be a friendly-fire incident, and she retaliated against the one who gave that order
						House Karthis was publicly neutral, but they privately backed unsavory 
			The Flying Heron is elfinrin steel
				She got it as a gift after saving a boy from drowning
			Viola: Any final requests?
				There is a woman not of this plane, some kind of myth or fairy tale
				Supposedly can forgive a great many things
					Or, rather, she takes on your burdens, so that your spirit can pass
				She pulls out a small pin
					It's of a bird, and it splits open to reveal a lock of golden hair
				Her wish is that this makes its way to wherever she's buried
			Who were Karthis's friends?
				He was close to the Chief Constable
				Viola howls with laughter
					She admits that Cheliff is dead and with the Coalition
		Back with Duport
			Viola asks for directions to Cheliff's house
				Nope, not without valid reasoning
				Wait for her in her office instead?
	Back upstairs
		We wait around in Cheliff's office for like an hour
			Duport pulls out olives from a desk drawer, scattering some papers in the process
				Viola catches a glimpse of a few notes
		Viola tries to weasel her way into getting Duport to leave the room
			He promised Buracir that he'd keep an eye on all of us, despite other work he has to do
		It gets down to the wire, and Viola has to pull the Cheliff-in-Coaltion-and-dead card
			FUCK
			Duport: Get out.  Go on the Bain pursuit, then report back, or else we will track you down
Early evening
	Viola reports back to the inn
		Iris and Tetron are pissed
			We have to take the deputy to the scene now
	Back to the gates of Greyguard
		Tetron Sendings Alice to come along as a witness
		We call for Duport
