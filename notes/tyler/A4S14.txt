Sunday late morning, Vault of Ratification
	COMBAT CONTINUES
		Order: Mirror spirits, Viola, Dragon, Tetron, Humanoid, Iris, Krug, Alistair, Glass Golem
		Round 3
			The mirror next to Alistair disappears, but Tetron realizes that they've changed places
				And then Tetron realizes that the "spirits still" clause means that we still need to break the mirrors, and that they're probably protecting the dragon now
			Viola tumbles past the glass golem, grazes it with a finisher, then takes her defensive stance
				Haste - 8 rounds remain
			Dragon emerges with the mirrors on it, then shoots a crystal projectile at Krug (hit), and then tries to use the projectile to calcify Krug (crit save)
				It has mirrors embedded on it: head, chest, left wing
					Higher AC for the mirror points, have to declare for attacking the mirrors
				Dazzled people will take damage when attacking it unless they avert their gaze
			Tetron magic missiles the mirrors, but they don't break
				He shouts out about the mirrors
			Humanoid unleashes an aura that fills the area with pointy crystals (difficult terrain), then hardens herself
			Iris creates a mirror duplicate, wipes the crystal dust off, then misses a strike
			Krug bashes the humanoid with his shield (hit, miss), then raises his shield
			Alistair brushes himself off, then shoots the humanoid (miss x2)
			Glass golem shoves Viola into one of the lights, then swipes at her (miss x2)
		Round 4
			Viola tumbles back past the glass golem, strikes it (crit), then uses her cape to move to the far side of the dragon
				Haste - 7 rounds remain
			Dragon drops another dazzling burst on Iris and Krug (both fail), then throws a crystal at one of the Irises (hit)
			Tetron step-casts haste on Iris, then readies a drained bonded item
			Humanoid touches Krug (Iris tries to interrupt, but only knicks her) (successful save), then steps aside
			Iris wipes the glitter off, intensifies vulnerability, then stabs twice (crit miss, miss)
				Haste - 9 rounds remain
			Krug shield bashes the humanoid (miss from dazzle, miss), then raises his shield
			Alistair shoots the humanoid (hit, miss, miss)
			Glass golem approaches Krug and Iris, then readies a self-destruct
		Round 5
			Viola fails a feint against the dragon, then activates her sword's enigma mirror to cast mirror image, which procs the thicket of knives, then attacks the left wing mirror (broken)
				Haste - 6 rounds remain
				Mirror image - 9 rounds remain
			The dragon swipes its tail at Viola (failed save), knocking her prone, then stomps on her (hit), then attempts to calcify her (save fails)
				Viola begins petrifying, slowing her
			Tetron drains his bonded item to cast a triple magic missile at the head mirror (no break)
			Humanoid strikes at Iris (miss) and then Krug (miss), then hardens
			Iris switches exploit vulnerability to the glass golem (crit success) to gain the sonic weakness, strikes three times (all miss)
				Vulnerability info:
					Immune: bleed, death, disease, doomed, fatigue, mental, necromancy, other stuff
					Weakness bludgeoning 7, sonic 11
					Resist fire 7
					Slowed by cold
				Haste - 8 rounds remain
			Krug shield bashes the glass golem (hit, miss, crit miss)
			Alistair shoots at the glass golem (crit miss, hit, hit)
			The glass golem explodes (Iris saves, Krug crit fails, humanoid crit fails)
				Krug uses Orc Ferocity to stay up
				Humanoid dies
		Round 6
			Viola strikes at head mirror (miss), feints (success), then grazes the head mirror with a finisher, breaking it
				Viola's petrification progresses, bringing her to slowed 2
				Haste - 5 rounds remain
				Mirror image - 8 rounds remain
			Dragon charges something
			Tetron casts lightning bolt at the dragon (failed save), then looks at what the dragon is doing
				Something is going on in its throat, so it's gonna shoot something in a line that'll hurt
			Iris exploits vulnerability (fail, so personal antithesis), moves behind a wall, then pulls and chugs a potion, and shouts at the crystal mage to take cover
			Krug runs over to Tetron, shoves him out of the line of fire, then takes cover himself
			Alistair moves up, shoots at the chest mirror (miss), then takes cover
		Round 7
			Viola feints, crit-finishers (last mirror broke)
				Viola becomes petrified
			Dragon smacks petrified Viola (hit with no break, then crit with no break, miss)
				It holds its breath
			Tetron steps up and casts hideous laughter (save success)
			Iris moves in, intensifies vulnerability, and strikes the dragon (hit, hit)
			Krug battle medicines himself, then LoHs himself, then runs in
			Alistair moves out into the open, shoots (hit), then ducks back into cover
		Round 8
			Dragon shifts to get Tetron into LoS and Iris interrupts it with a fatal blow
	After combat

			Alistair - perceive a trap/hazard but allow an ally to fall into it - success
			Viola - move three actions in a single round - success
			Krug - get three different buffs from allies - failed (only two)
		We took roughly the same time as the Silver Squires, we were slightly faster
		Silver Squires
			Spent the time to solve the puzzle
				Took a bit longer than us
			Fought the constructs well
			Handled hazards
			Froze the crap out of the tsunami elemental
			Two of them fell to lower bridges and had to navigate the maze-like route back up, taking over an hour
			Magic missiled all mirrors before they could go onto the dragon
		Bucket Brigade
			Immediately hit the buttons
			Threw sharp implements and poisons into the constricting hall
			One fell into the void
			An enlarged party member grabbed the fire elemental and yeeted themselves in with it
			Shattered no mirrors
			Hours-long fight against the dragon and stuff
		Bucket Brigade receive no certification
		Silver Squires gain provisional Adept status
		We gain full Adept status
	After review
		Time for bed
		While we're in bed, Krug, Alistair, and Viola hear a distant boom
			Viola notices a bright yellow-orange beam shooting upward back toward Cassomir (closer than the city is)
				She goes to the proctors about this
					We'd need to waive liability from the IMG in order to investigate
					Viola goes to wake up the rest of the party
						We didn't see anything on the way back here
						She asks whether we should tap the Silver Squires
							She mentions that she deliberately omitted the Bucket Brigade
								Alistair suggests that they could work as meat shields
								Everyone else objects
					We rouse the Silver Squires
						They offer to go in exchange for us helping them with an event tomorrow
							They're offering a half-day's healing to folks in Cur's Tooth
							Tetron wonders how we'd be helpful...
							Being done in Iomedae's name
								Iris refuses
							Tetron insists that, as Adept LAPs, it's kind of their duty to help with this sort of thing
								Also, the stuff we want to do tomorrow is a better means of us helping Cassomir than this
							Party split
								Krug and Alistair are down
								Iris and Tetron are not
								Viola ends up being the deciding vote: our talents are better spent split
	Toward the explosion site
		Alistair scouting ahead
			He smells burnt timber
			There's a big ol charred crater now
				Like a smaller version of what happened to Patia's workshop
			Three people were here
				Two sets of footprints are humanoid, the third is odd
					Third seems like maybe it transformed, going from shoes to some other weird shape
				And then they left
					Back toward town
		The rest of us catch up
			Viola asks whether Iris wants to puruse
			What are the weird footprints...
				Tetron thinks its definitely a shapeshifter
				Not mammalian
		We follow the tracks a ways
			Footprints stop suddenly at a small cliff down
				No indication of magic used
				It's swampy muck from there
			Viola suggests sending Taranis to scout
				Yup
				After a bit, he was able to barely make out something in the distance
					Whatever it was was large and fast
						Aerial
							Context for determining what the footprints could be?
								Krug realizes that these footprints are similar to reptilian mounts that he knew back in Belkzen
							Perhaps one of the Bains?
								Not proper dragon footprint...
								Could be the son?
								We have to catch Iris up
								Iris considers whether her parents could be associated with the Bains
									Access to whack gene bullshit might be appealing to her parents
									Power and service is more important to them than particular goals
									Could be both parents and Kyphon or one parent, Sirram, and Kyphon
									Tetron pitches that it could have also just been Sirram's wife too
			What got blowed up?
				Viola and Alistair don't find crap
			We should go back to bed
				We walked an hour to get over here
					Viola suggests that we just camp here
						Except keeping watch would cost more time than just walking back to camp
	Back to sleep
		The others do leave before us
Moonday midmorning
	Back to town
	Tetron makes phantom steeds
Moonday late morning
	Arrive at Cassomir
	Now to have Taranis look for Borgan
		Goes off for a while
	Alistair suggests that we look into Adept-only jobs
		But he's going off to talk to Patia instead
			Iris'll follow along
	Taranis returns
		Thinks he found what "may be Borgan"
		Wasn't able to get a good look because it's in a cloth-covered cage
		Heard owl screaming
		Where was this?
			Outdoor area of the Roaring Hall
			May be on sale
		Cluster of cages
	Roaring Hall
		It's an indoor marketplace
		Mageseeker dogs are everywhere
		We walk through to the outdoor section
			We find a lion-like catfolk attending the pet stall
		We discuss our approach
			Viola intends on reporting Borgan as stolen goods
				Tetron was thinking that she make up a story about wanting to give a crappy pet to a hated relative
			A halfling bumps Tetron and snatches his love? potion
				Tetron follows
					He witnesses the halfling steal from someone else and alerts the victim
						It's a frilled lizardfolk who frills up and runs after the halfling
						He punches the halfling as guards arrive
		Viola goes up
			Reporting Borgan as stolen goods
				Often sells familiars of late masters
					We know that Borgan's master isn't dead
					Can sell to us
						Viola: We (wizard and I) don't have need for familiars
					Tetron walks over to verify the communication with the family
				Insists that he got Borgan from a reputable source
					Was it Amos Olgir?
						No
						Not legit
			Tetron calls Krug over as a truthteller
				Dude wants to know that we're Adept
					Yup
				Dude wants Krug to prove his faith
					Searing Bulwark cast on Tetron
					This is legit
			Dude pulls out Borgan
				Curtain aside and he immediately reacts to recognizing us
				Dude hands Borgan over
			So, who sold him?
				Krug makes the ethical argument
				Dude really wants 100 gp
					Krug pays it
				He pulls us to the back
					Tells us that they're a dwarf
						Hides his appearance as though he were a halfling
						Gaultier the Glabrate
						Fearful and dodgy
						"Entirely naked on the face"
						Distant merchant
						Seen rarely
			Dude sells familiar accessories
				Tsavo the Lion Merchant
	Hosetter Military Base
		They're asked their business
			The clerk lets them know that someone in the party has correspondence waiting at the Port Authority
				Tetron, specifically
		They find Patia in the same place she was before
			Guard count has been heightened
				Iris asks what the deal is
					Three murders.
						One person patrolling outside town on the road toward Almas
						One person patrolling Deepspring
						One person guarding Steelcross Bridge
						Murders believed to be retaliatory
						Methods
							Neck snapped
							Partially decapitated
							Ripped apart
							Clearly meant to be spectacles
							Who could this indicate?
								Definitely not Iris's mom
								Could be Kyphon?
									Alistair points out that Kyphon's killings of the bandits in Andoran involved gore wounds
								Viola: They would have to be able to get away really easily
						Everything is fine on the Taldan side, according to Greyguard Castle
			Iris introduces Alistair
				Alistair asks if she can make replacement fingers
					Cost-prohibitive for most folks
						Alistair asks the specific cost
							Depends
							Especially if extra magic features are requested
					Alistair explains his intent for folks in Cur's Tooth
						He asks whether them doing stuff for the Bellflower Network could make up for the cost
							She loves the idea
	Party reconvenes on the Taldan side of the river
		Tetron wants to let 
		Iris reports Tetron's correspondence
		Iris reports the guard murders
		Alistair mentions his intent to head to Cur's Tooth
			Offers to ask about the murders and other such topics
		Iris meets Borgan for the first time
		Tetron wants to go pick up his package and then reconvene at the inn to talk to Borgan
	Port Authority
		Tetron receives a small packet containing cufflinks bearing the House Hyperius emblem
			With a note from Zaugia saying that she has word that Sloane is operating in Cassomir now (out of Roaring Hall) and that Mihail is gone
				He volunteered to try to expose and drive out Coalition agents deploying addlebrain in Copperdown
	Back in the inn
		Tetron reports Zaugia's note
			This eliminates Roaring Hall from being a place where Iris's parents are hiding
		Tetron pulls out Borgan
			HE CAN TALK
			Amos is still alive
