Skipping to Wealday
	We've been in custody for a day and a half
		Interrogated by the national government
		Clutch's even more illicit activities exposed
			Aided by the documents Alistair found
		We're cleared, except for the fact that we keep being found in "interesting" situations
			They tell us to calm our tits
	Tetron avoided capture due to having been invisible
	Additional goings-on
		Clutch's fighting ring has been exposed
			Chase's brother found and taken to a clinic for treatment
		Viola continues her participation in her play
	Loot!
		The worm in the Aroden temple has been taken care of by the authorities
		+1 striking shock shortbow == Alistair
		+1 resilient fire-resistant leather armor == Krug
		moderate potion of electricity retaliation == Krug
		+1 resilient explorer's clothes == Tetron
		wand of manifold missiles == Tetron
		gloves of storage == Viola
		greater staff of healing == Tetron
		2 +1 striking fauchards == MELT
		2 +1 breastplates == MELT

		4 armor potency
		2 weapon potency
		2 striking
		2 breastplates
		2 fauchards
		-> 160 * 4 + 35 * 2 + 65 * 2 + 2 * 8 + 2 * 1.4 -> sell for 429.4 gp
		223 each overall
	Alistair got to keep his loot from the Clutch
		Tetron made him promise
		Menacing rune
	We're brought to the Cerulean Keep commander, Lysilla Koran
		Regarding under-city activities
		Calls our methods "unorthodox"
		Acknowledges the Aegis Coalition as a serious threat
		Due to the nature of the event, they aren't able to publicly talk about the events or connect them to us
			The presence of the temple and the stuff that happened there is not a good look
		The city has given us a boon, but we get a choice:
			Permanent residence
				Can we see the house?
					Yes
					It's in Liberty
					Enough room for us and even additional activities
			A boat
				Large enough to support a small crew in addition to us
				Modest quarters
			Could also take it in cash
			Tetron asks if we can hold on that decision
				Yes, we can
We're contacted by Chase, and Viola goes to meet up
	Greeted by a modest sack of coin (35 gp)
	Introduces his brother, Deryll
	Insists that he'll help us with whatever beef we have
	Has made a friend in the ring recently: Bilnog
		He asked to meet Viola
	Bilnog is Nilbog's brother
		He's looking to bring back Nilbog to stand trial
		Turns out that the person Nilbog was exiled for accidentally killing didn't actually die
			"Can't even check a pulse"
	Viola explains that we don't know where Nilbog is
		Bilnog refuses to let us out of his sight
Bilnog follows Viola back to the Birch Branch
	Viola introduces Bilnog to the others
	Bilnog explains the situation
	Krug goes to bat for Nilbog's character
	Bilnog says that Nilbog has to be publicly shamed
		Viola jokes that Nilbog has definitely publically embarassed himself
	Alistair sees a red hand start to tap on the window
		He ignores it
		Tetron is the next to notice
			"Hey, would Chimpy know where Nilbog is?"
				"YES"
			He opens the window
	Chimpy reports that Zaknos and Nilbog are being held in "Glat"
		Chimpy tried to read
			It's Galt
		Strong dudes there
		Zaknos's family there
		Captors don't know about Chimpy
		Chimpy teleported back here
			He can do that once per day
		We need to get them out
			Teleporting there would be dangerous

Toilday
	Tetron buys a cheap scroll and has Chimpy try to teleport with it
		The scroll drops to the floor as Chimpy poofs away
	Vote of no confidence has occurred, but results are still being tallied
Fast forward
	Chimpy tests
		Do Zaknos and Nilbog want to return?
			Yes
			Zaknos says that he has some stuff to take care of before he leaves, regarding his siblings
		Tetron tries to have Chimpy teleport with a sheet of mundane paper (Allison Vistrum's suicide nots)
			That doesn't work
		How much time does Zaknos need?
			Something's wrong mentally with his sister
			He wants to leave with her
		Continued attempts to teleport with the scroll
			It eventually works
			He's gained some strength from Zaknos's blood
Moonday, 28 Rova
	We receive a summons from the government to meet in the Cerulean Keep
		The missive asks for the entire party's presence
		We're escorted to a different wing than we've been before
		Major Zenza catches up with us
			It's unusual
			She doesn't know anything
			Treat this meeting with dignity
		We find ourselves before Eagle Knight Commander, Reginald Cormuth
			Next to him is another individual
			He's been notified that the Chelaxian military is planning retaliation for the operation we undertook with Arnault
			Adjacent to the matter, however, is the individual next to him
				She is wearing a mask
				This is Iris Kaulfield, a odd-looking human
				She asks what the status of the enemy ship's captain is
					Pissed, broken rudder
				Do we have any of her effects
					We sold some of it, used some of it to disrupt the Aegis Coalition's ritual
					Oh well
				Iris asks to accompany us should we encounter Capt. Kaulfield again
					Viola: Well, she did swear blood vengeance against us
					Iris: Any opportunity to gut her like the pig she is
						Iris pulls open her cloak to reveal a religious symbol of Arazni
							Huh...
				Tetron is able to identify Iris as a ganzi
				Tetron asks how we can trust Iris to not go rogue
					Viola elaborates about Tessra's misguided "vengeance"
					Iris makes it clear that 
	On the way out, we're stopped by Lt Molinaro
		He asks when we'd like to tackle the erinyes
		Viola laughs out loud
			The relevant person is absent
			We'll need to postpone
		We send our regards to Kuktun
	We go to the potential house to see it
		Large townhome
		3 stories and a back garden
		6 bedrooms
		Stone facade
		Finely furnished
		Cellar
		After much arguing, we decide to take the house and rent it out until we can reliably return for permanent residence
		We've named it the 
	This is the day of Viola's last performance
	It's also Viola's 21st birthday!!!
		She wants lobster
		We go to a swanky place in Gillmen's Moor
		Tetron gets the staff to sing
		Back at the Birch Branch, Viola is handed a small box wrapped with twine
			She opens it in her room
			Within is a piece of parchment atop a small coil
				"Happy Birthday.  Hope this is something you can make use of.  Thinking of you."
				Signed by her parents
				The coil is a beaded ribbon meant as an accessory for her sword hilt
	Tetron sends Chimpy to ask whether there's someone on Zaknos's end who can cast teleport
Toilday
	No word from Chimpy
	Working on tenants
Wealday
	Zaknos and Nilbog attempt their teleportation scheme
	In Viola's room, as we do daily prep, a fireball announces the arrival of teleporting people:
		Iris and Bilnog receive heavy burns
		Nilbog, singed, in a neck cuff
		Zaknos, also in a neck cuff
		Older man with a beard and wiry hair, religious robes
	The two are tossed onto the floor
		"You two thought you could ruin my plans?!"
		Dude is defensive about Katya
			"I raised her to be perfect!"
		Dude: I await the day that we meet
			As dude teleports away, Viola: "But we're meeting right now."
	Tetron grabs the decanter from Nilbog and starts to put out the fire
		Meanwhile, the rest of the inn's occupants are panicking
		Tetron also starts using aqueous orb, twice
		Iris quickly prepares an esoteric scroll of summon elemental to summon a water mephit
		Alistair starts casting spout
	Bilnog tackles Nilbog
		Zaknos: Hey, you look like Nilbog!
		Bilnog starts to drag Nilbog away
		Krug intervenes
		Nilbog casts calm emotions on Bilnog
		Now that Bilnog is calm, Nilbog starts asking what is going on
	And then we're all detained
		Bilnog resists arrest, claiming that he's the one who should be doing the detaining
Oathday
	After much interrogation and with resignation, we're released
	We owe 400 gp
		Zaknos's sandwich shop puts up 300 gp
		Zaknos personally pays the rest
		Zaknos takes responsibility since it was his dad
	Zaknos decides that he's going to stick around and personally work at the shop
		Oh, he can manage the house!
	Iris offers to get vengeance on Zaknos's dad
		Zaknos is down
	What do we do about the erinyes?
		Should definitely do that before we leave town
	Bilnog desparately wants to leave with Nilbog
		He tries to coerce Alistair into helping
			Alistair doesn't give him anything
		Krug tries to step in to have things be talked through
			Tetron suggests that Bilnog stick around and observe Nilbog
			Iris offers to just have us carry out the public shaming
				This is acceptable to Bilnog
	We walk out to the Field of Concord
		We invite the management of the Birch Branch
		Bilnog starts the proceedings
			He ties Nilbog to a stick
			He gives a speech to detail the crime of desertion
			And then we each in turn tepidly shame him and throw pebbles
		Bilnog is satisfied
		Would Nilbog like to return home now, as a free citizen?
			Nilbog declines, saying that it was nice to see his brother
		Before he leaves, Bilnog yanks one of Nilbog's hairs out as proof
	House arrangement
		2 rooms reserved for us
		2 rooms each for renting parties
		It's called SunnySide
	Erinyes battleplan
		We have Kuktun
		Zaknos and Nilbog have secured divine assistance
		Alistair taps the Greencloaks
			They can't really help
			But they do point him towards Omerta
				Since we helped Udella, they owe us a favor
		Tetron taps his classmates
			Cyrus looks super surprised
				He wasn't expecting Tetron to come around with all the goings on
				Cyrus didn't know where to find us
				He has something for Tetron
					A box of six familiar morsels
						Keyed to speech
				Tetron finally gets around to asking about the erinyes
			He also asks around the university if anybody wants killing some devils on their resume
		Alistair tries to flex our accomplishments to see if that can get Dorfinn and Carol released
			Turns out that is already in progress
			It also turns out that Gavel Tarsus is in a shit negotiation position and is allowing gov't forces to serve as security

Note: Iris's birthday is 30 Neth
