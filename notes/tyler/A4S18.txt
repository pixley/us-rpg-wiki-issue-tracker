Toilday night
	Viola and Krug at the front of the fleeing action
		We hear a guard yell something about the topiary entrance
			Sounds of bone-break-like noises
			Screaming (not human-like, wyrm-like)
	Others bringing up the rear
		Alistair hears the sound of beating wings
			Sounds like they're heading toward us, but then stops
			Doesn't bother to turn back to look
			Female dragon screams
		Iris lifts Tetron over the fence with her remaining boot-flight
		Alistair heaves his makeshift bag over the fence and scurries over
		Second set of wings flaps out to the garden
		Bright light comes from behind
	Sprinting through the city
		Some guards notice Alistair, Iris, and Tetron and ask what's going on
			Especially Alistair's bag
			Tetron and Alistair tell them about the murders at the Bains'
			Dude seems to take them seriously, then looks up toward the hill the Bains' house is on
				Shit be bright
			The guards start running in that direction
		Krug and Viola escort Margot and the Vaylens to their home
			Krug has the kid in his arm
				She's in shock
			Lady Vaylen is whinging on and on about the disrespect
				Her dress is fucked, and she has a cut from the window we broke through
				Loudly enough that folks are opening their shutters to see what the commotion is
					And then they notice the light coming from the Bains'
			We arrive back at the Vaylens'
				Healers called
				Viola and Krug left alone with the kid
					They talk to her
						She is confused as to why she's at the "enemy" house
							Viola admits that we're adventurers, not Vaylen servants
				Margot comes over
					She checks in with the kid
					She asks what we did/found
						Viola gives the rundown
					She looks out the window toward the Bains'
						Guards converging
						Fire being fought
						Some kind of containment spell has been cast over the property
					Margot insists that we find a new place to stay
						She has a recommendation
					She believes that we have a small window of opportunity to gather further intelligence
						The people the Taldans will send are going to be thorough...
						But whatever dangers are within will probably be too much for the first response
						Tonight would be the only opportunity we would have to investigate
						She's willing to pay
						She thinks the Kaulfield connection is also good to sus out
					Viola and Krug are on board
						Need to confer with others
						Tetron tapped out and beat up
						What's the timing?
							Second response would be 5 am at the earliest
					Margot comforts the kid
						Shiloh is her name
						Margot guarantees safety and promises to return her as soon as we figure out what's going on
						Shiloh has an older brother, but he doesn't live here
					Viola returns the jewels
				We're dismissed
					If the others were coming, they'd be here by now
					To Hosetter to get their shit
		Back with the other three
			Tetron: we need to find a new place to crash
				Iris figures that Alistair's contacts at Cur's Tooth would be a potential route
					Tetron: Could endanger them
				Iris: Should probably stay on the Andoren side
					More danger on the Taldan side
					Kaulfields liable to depart in short order
	At Hosetter
		We regroup and get our shit
		Iris: need to address Kaulfields
		Need to live somewhere else
			Margot's recommendation: Black Pit Tavern
				Kind of pricey
				Has means of guest security, including anti-scrying
				Near Murkback Keep
			What about Hosetter?
		Viola fills everyone in on Margot's job
		Krug is healing Tetron the entire time
		Viola: concern about staying at Hosetter
			Could cause perceived connection between House Vaylen and Andoran
				Bad for Margot's cover
		Let's tell Margot that we're in
	Back to the Taldan side
		Huge smoke plume coming from the Bains' garden
		Arrive at Black Pit Tavern
			It's small
			Quiet inside (it's like 10:30)
			Floor pillows on the floor of the main hall
				Qadiran vibe
			Vibe is relaxed
			Doesn't really look like there's a place to crash here...
			We're approached by staff
				Dark-skinned woman informs us that we'd be all in one suite
					She refers to herself as "Auntie"
				She indicates a diving board in the middle of the room
					It's an entrance to an extraplanar room
					We're handed runes for access
					The only outside communication is a "knock" from staff
					5 gp per night
						1 per person
			Tetron gives the place a one-over, and is satisfied
			Breakfast from 6 to 10
	In our room
		Krug first
			He gets to configure the room
				NOPE
		Tetron goes in now
			He goes full nobleman on that shit
		The rest of us enter
			Iris gives Tetron shit
		Time for Alistair's haul
			Robe - mundane silk ceremonial
			Shield - green dragonscale 
				Moderate reinforcing rune
				Dragon's breath rune
			Dagger - ornate but otherwise ordinary
				+2 potency
				greater striking
				flaming
				cunning
			Boots - match shield, magical
				~dinosaur~ dragon boots
			Wand - wand of hopeless night
			Second robe - acid energy robe
			Swampy potion - greater juggernaut mutagen
			Scrolls
				corrosive body
				dragon form
				baleful polymorph -> cursed metamorphosis
				grisly growths
			We shouldn't try to do stuff with this right now, esp runes
		Tetron reallocates spells
			asks haste or levitate
				HASTE
			He feels a creeping presence in the back of his mind, offering granting of spell slots
				Maybe later...
		Borgon has been asking all kinds of questions
			Viola regales him
			He berates us
Middle of the night, Wealday
	To the Bains'
		Stealth approach
			Iris makes Krug invisible
			Tetron does the same to himself
			Rest of us are sneaky
		Guard presence
			Entrances barred
			Can see folks looking around upstairs through the windows
		Looking into the garden
			The topiary cover has been melted and pried open
				Markers around it
				And there are guards watching from the back patio
		How to get in...
			Much humming and hawing
				Distractions
			Viola: could we open a window on the side of the house?
				There are windows right next to the basement entrance
					Alistair gets to work
						Gets it open basically instantly
		Infiltration
			Alistair notices a guard in the same room, but around a corner
				Viola and Iris sneak in
				Tetron and Krug also go in
					Krug is noise, but also invisible
			Alistair starts scoping out the basement
				There is a door further in that had been trapped, but the trap is disabled
			Guard comes to investigate the noise the Krug made falling through the window
				Tetron makes an illusory guard
					Claims to have needed some fresh air and accidentally made way more noise than intended
						They don't buy it
						The illusory guard jumps out the window
							Krug times his movement out of the way to match the illusory guard's jump
								He gets away with it
					Guards go outside to start searching for the illusory guard
		In the cellar
			We can hear a clicking sound
			Alistair picks the door open
				He slowly opens the door and peers in
					Chained to the corner of the room within is a two-headed creature
						Tons of eyes
						Several dead guards at its feet
						It's been lightly hurt
							Two spears lodged in its back between its wings
							One wing is busted
						Larger head is sleeping
						Smaller head is just sitting and seemingly zoned out
		Into the basement
			Alistair creeps down to see whether he would get the creature's attention
			Floor is cracked and warped
				Indicative of acid
			The creature's mouth has eyes in it too
			Alistair sneaks along the wall
			Iris takes a look and has no idea what it is
				Neither does Tetron
				But Krug does!!!
					It's a rotten husk of what was once a normal dragon, but its been zombified and frankensteined
					It's lethargic
			Alistair readies a sneak attack
PREPARE FOR BATTLE
	Iris exploits vulnerability
		Weak to slashing and vitality
	Alistair first strikes with a gouging claw spellstrike (hit)
	Round 1
		Tetron casts telekinetic projectile (hit), then shields
			Invisibility broken
		The larger head wakes up and bites at Alistair (hit) then claws at him (hit)
		The smaller head belches acid toward the entrance to the room (Iris crit fails, Tetron succeeds)
		Alistair stabs more (miss, hit, miss)
		Viola moves in to flank with Alistair, fails a feint, then takes her dueling posture
		Krug charges at the creature (crit), then raises his shield
		Iris moves in, stabs (hit, miss)
	Round 2
		Tetron analyzes the creature's defenses, then casts telekinetic projectile (miss)
		The larger head bites at Alistair (dodge to miss), then at Krug (hit, blocked)
		The smaller head bites at Iris (miss), then roars (Viola and Alistair become frightened)
		Alistair stabs (crit, hit), killing the creature
Post battle
	Tetron: we should lock the door behind us
	Iris is in rough shape
		Tetron three-action heals
		Krug quickly patches up Iris, Alistair
		Iris drinks a health potion
	Tetron notices that the door to the right is slightly colder to the touch and smells earth
	Alistair checks the doors
		No traps, mundane, but locks
	Alistair picks open the door to the left
		Small hallway
			Three paintings on one side, three animal heads on the other
				Paintings
					Grimacing figure writhing in a pool of acid
					Combination of chromatic dragons
					Figure burning to death
				Animals
					Two boars and a bear
			Alistair checks for traps, doesn't see any, then traipses on through
			Iris doesn't trust this, and she notices pressure plates
				Alistair comes back to address them
					But he doesn't want to disable them in case they do something else
						Tetron comes to look to see what the mechanism does
							The plates connect to the portraits and emit something
							But what does the center one do?
								Prismatic Spray
					Disable
						First succeeds
						Second crit succeeds
						Third succeeds
		Room past the hallway
			Library/lab situation
			There's a dead body in the corner
			Two statues holding basins flanking a double door
				They're empty
			Two fountains
			Tetron starts scanning the books
				Mundane
				Topics
					Wildlife
					Mutagens and other alchemy
					Acid
					Dragons
					Time magic
						Evidence!
						One is laying open on a table
							Current page describes disruption of the First World's environment
								We bookmark this one
			Iris inspects tables
				Finds documents
					Taxes
					One page burned beyond recognition
					Recently-written paper
						Mentions receipt of a box for reference and safe-keeping
							A staff member attempted to use it and died
							Kept in the northmost chamber
					The burned page catches Viola's interest
						She can't tell what caused the damage
						Tetron tells her to grab it anyway so we can restore it later
			Iris looks at the body
				One of the Bains' guards
				She assumes that this was the guy who touched the box
			Alistair looks for valuables
				Nope
			Tetron inspects the lab tables
				Potions
					Two minor healing and a moderate healing
					Some other ones he doesn't recognize immediately
						Some look unstable
						After a closer look, they seem to be some kind of accelerant
			Alistair approaches the door with the death box inside
				He hears a faint humming, and it's clearly trapped, and something is meant to burst through the door
			Alistair takes a look at the basins, trying to see what previously filled it
				Some kind of rustish thing, could have been blood
				We realize that they're probably just the means to get into Kyphon's chamber
			We decide to take a look in the southern room instead
				It's another hallway, but a tunnel has been burrowed through one of the walls
					Is it trapped?
						Not anymore, the passage probably supplanted its use as a hazard
			Northern door
				Can we open it without being in front of it?
					Telekinetic hand?
						It's locked
					Alistair could contort himself to pick from the side
						After three tries, he gets the lock open, but he loses his balance and triggers the trap
							And it crits him with an acidic dart
					Tetron opens the door as Alistair pulls away
			Iris notices a secret entrance behind the southern fountain
