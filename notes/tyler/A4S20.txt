Wealday midday
	Archdruids' chambers, Heartwood, Isle of Arenway
		The archdruids briefly discuss before doing some magical analysis of the egg
		"Flesh, shell, blood, reveal your truth..." ritual words
			The egg is encased in a thin fibrous netting of dried moss, then an orb of water, then greenery
			Eventually, the layers fall away and the ritual concludes
		Achak has looked into the embryo's body and has found an affinity for fire and acid
			Not great to have in a forest
			Comes from a combo of dragon and fleshwarping
			Also is growing unnaturally quickly
				Will grow, live, and die sooner
			Also will be quadrapedal, rather than bipedal
		Eno-Nez has looked into the mind of the embryo
			Feral and developed tendencies in conflict with each other
			Raising would require careful training
		Brioni has looked into the soul of the embryo
			Penchant for selfishness, but capacity for change
		They then retire to a separate chamber to discuss
			For like an hour
		Archdruids return with more questions
			Condition of her family?
				Viola responds truthfully
			Family's ability to change for the better?
				Viola: Doubt it
				Tetron: Kyphon could have been better if given the opportunity during childhood
		Judgement statement
			Achek: If we take the child in the Heartwood, that places the community at risk, should raising fail
			Briani suggests to instead gather various senior community members around the Heartwood to raise through community
				Would require unanimous consent
			We are given time to campaign to the community leaders
	We're released from the session
		Tetron figures that we should ask Takua or a Hundred Sun Pine attendant to whom we should talk
			We get the list from an attendant
			Viola: We should all talk to Takua (the yak guy) and form a gameplan before splitting up
	Back at Favors of the Wild
		We pull Takua aside
		We explain the egg in full
		Takua asks whether we would accept the child, were we in their position
		Takua doesn't feel comfortable trying to influence the others himself
			Tetron: What about the general leanings of the other leaders
				Ink Cap Inn owners likely on board
					They already care for the giant snails and other such creatures
				More difficult would be the elf who runs the tattoo shop
				Forest guide doesn't like having things thrust upon him
					Would be the one foraging for rare foods
				Passing Place is where the dead are handled
					The person who runs it is reasonable and generally unopinionated
				General advice: the charitable approach wouldn't necessarily work
		What about Takua's own leanings?
			Fatherhood would be new to him
			He would also hear the arguments of his comrades
		Split up?
			Yeah, probably.  Tetron and Iris, then Krug, Alistair, and Viola
	Tetron and Iris at the Ink Cap Inn
		Less of a building and more of a tree with large mushroom growing out the top
		They're invited in for food by a woman named Mabel
		Tetron leverages his interest in magical creatures by way of his boyfriend to find common interest with Mabel
			And that's his in with the topic
			He also shows off Taranis
			Eventually admit that we're here on business regarding a creature ourselves
				Tetron describes
					The combination of creature and humanoid is surprising to her
				Iris: Makes more sense to treat her as a person
			Mabel's wife Autumn comes in, and she's caught up
			After explanation, Autumn is thrilled
				Mabel less gung-ho, but open
				Takua mentioned, and Autumn thinks he'd be great
				They're willing to chat with the warden
					The one at the Passing Place
					Not so much with the tattoo artist, would be difficult
						Maitho
						Info: Apparently, Iris has the right vibe
	Krug, Alistair, and Viola at Moondance Pools
		One is sunbathing on the top of the spire, other is talking to a mushroom leshy woman
		Alistair approaches the sunbathing one
			They seem weirdly interested in the power of the child
				Weirds Krug out
				Alistair tries to spin it toward defense
			Their sibling finishes their conversation and flies over to be caught up
				They are also put off
				They are interested in the guardian angle
				They ask their brother to fetch their father
				They ask why the Heartwood
					Viola explains that we see the Heartwood as a good place for people with great differences
					Cities like Almas and Oppara would see her as a subject of scientific study
			The father arrives and is caught up
				Wonders why we'd treat her as a person rather than something to be tied up in a pen
				More interested in the defense angle
					Especially being originally of the First World, he has to return from time to time
	Alistair and Tetron approach the Passing Place
		Autumn is already inside talking up a storm
			Her interloqutor seems to have been in the middle of some ritual
			Autumn finally stops talking when Tetron speaks
			Iris offers to come back at a better time
				Just a few minutes to finish blessing this body
		After the ritual
			Iris gives the rundown
			They are concerned about the balance of the Heartwood
				Iris figures that the balance would be disrupted no more than a normal child would cause, just requiring more care
			They ask whether the child is natural
				Iris admits to the contrary
				Turns out that she is also fleshwarped
			She is concerned about the parents coming upon the Heartwood
				Iris assures her that she intends to slay the Bains on-sight
			Tetron acknowledges her potential as a role-model fleshwarp
	Reconvening
		Only one left
		Iris picks Tetron and Alistair to talk to the tattoo artist
			Viola: I mean, Takua did say that they'd vibe with Iris, which almost certainly means not Krug and me
		Krug and Viola decide to find others to chat with
			Ambrosia lady to apologize
	Iris, Tetron, and Alistair at Soul's Colors
		No one visible at first, but an acorn is thrown down from above
		Iris asks for a walk-in
			She's interested in a purple iris on her shoulder
				They immediately suggest that Iris is interested in a Bewitching Bloom
					Iris doesn't have the money for that - she just wants a mundane foundation to get one later
					Unfortunately, they only have the materials for magical ones
					However, they don't necessarily need to be paid in gold
						What needs doing?
							They would like a curse inflicted upon someone
								They pull out a finger and a lock of hair
								Something was stolen that cannot be returned
									Want to retaliate without death, only suffering
								The individual in question is named Harsh Rahal
									In Oppara
		To the topic at hand
			Iris and Tetron give the rundown
			Very philosophical discussion
			Comes down to Alistair's experiences in the Greencloaks
				They ask Alistair to strike them
					They don't even dodge as Alistair's sword pierces their stomach
				On board
	Krug and Viola at the Hall of Wild Ambrosia
		Viola apologizes
		We inform her of the meeting
			She panics because the hall is the meeting space
	Done
		To Almas
			But do we have permission to change the portal's destination?
				Viola: We should ask
					Alistair: The inn lady (Autumn) would know who to ask
		Autumn isn't a magician, but Mabel is
			Mabel teaches Alistair 
Almas
	Up the tunnel
	No one is at the temple
		Viola: Head to the Basil Banner and ask Zaknos?
	Timberfell is locked down, have to go around
	At the Basil Banner
		Pretty busy
			Dapper catfolk
			The needful doll is alive now
				Talking to Zaknos
				Tetron 
	At SunnySide
		Talking with Lida
			New info:
				Zahir sought to create the perfect family, but his family wasn't as perfect as he wanted
					Lida wasn't particularly obedient
					Leonid was quiet
					Katya was rambunctious and unladylike
				When Zaknos was a toddler, Zahir did a ritual to be able to control members of the family
					This was renewed yearly
					The first time she broke out, it was because she accidentally pricked her finger while Zahir
					Lida kind of started the snargie thing by blaming them for her behaviors to stay lucid
						Throwing away thimbles, putting sharp things in her shoes, etc
					His grip tightened until he left for Galt
					Katya is still under his influence
					She acknowledges that, should we continue to pursue the Coalition, we'll come into conflict with Zahir and Katya
					She offers any info she can
						Tetron asks about weaknesses
							Zahir is very proud
								He serves under Jericho at present, but he seeks the higher position
						Viola asks about leads they're pursuing regarding the prophecy
							Amos and Alice conceived Fleche to fit the prophecy, with the intent to sacrifice
						Tetron asks of telltale signs of membership
							Shield tattoo under the tongue
	To Dorfinn
		Alistair seeks advice on selling stuff
			Perhaps splitting them up
			Selling them to folks likely to leave town
