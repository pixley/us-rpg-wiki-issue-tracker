Starday afternoon
	Iris suggests doing a happy hour
		Tetron requests a "classy" bar
		We end up at a place with dark wood and velvet
		We get sangria to share, plus individual drinks
			Iris: Screwdriver
			Tetron: Grasshopper
			Krug: SOMETHING BIG... a pitcher of margarita
			Viola: I always get a daquiri...
				What's the special?  Lily's Liver
					Controversial due to ease of slipping poisons
						Iris changes her order
				Viola gets a mimosa instead
		Krug suggests that we bring in Zaknos and Nilbog to have this be a last celebration
			We summon Chimpy and tell him to get them
			Iris asks him to taste-test the Lily's Liver
	Meanwhile, over with Alistair and Stareye
		Dorfinn is finally released
			As his shackles are removed, he pulls his hood back to enjoy the sun as a free man
		Once Dorfinn is done, he walks over
			Stareye hands him a potion vial
			And then he dismisses Stareye
			He says he wants to chat with Alistair privately for a bit
		Dorfinn leads Alistair to a quiet area in the Liberty District
			Before he gets into it, he asks Alistair if he's emotionally strong enough to have this conversation
				[[Warning: speaking a demon's true name gets its attention, rather than having power over it]]
				Reason for this is that Alistair's life is interesting and that he'll be able to handle what comes next
			He says that the new interior stitching of Alistair came from his old blanket
			Dorfinn has a potion of shared memories, but he's going to lay some groundwork first
			The story begins
				15 or 20 years ago, there are three raggity adults in a circle, Sloane, Dorfinn, and a third individual
				They're sitting under a bridge and using sticks to scrounge fish
				Sloane talks about her time in Taldor
					She was living with a "fucking insane" old man who was obsessed with finding "that woman"
						Heard a new development on the streets
						Dude had cheated on his wife before she died
						Dude had been convinced that his soul was going to a bad place
						There's apparently this woman who can wipe your sins
							Dorfinn says that's stupid, but Sloane says it's legit
						Dude was obsessed with finding this woman
						She's apparently super pure
				Third dude's name is Peter
					Dorfinn asks if he's going to finish his fish
					Peter is actually considering finding this woman...
						He has regrets about the way he and Dorfinn have gotten through life
				A year after that conversation, Sloane went back to Taldor to start information network, but the two remain allies
				After that, Dorfinn and Peter start the Greencloaks, but Peter leaves after some time to pursue the woman
			Dorfinn offers the vial to Alistair
				He was met, the day Alistair was born, by a woman
				He doesn't remember the whole thing, as she wiped his memory
					But the missing details are in the vial, a potion of shared memories
				She had some kind of pain about "this place" [Almas?]
				This woman was the one who left Alistair on the steps of Tamuth House
					She instructed him to let Alistair grow up there
				Alistair: where did she go?
					Right after their conversation, she aged rapidly and died, vanishing in the process
				Alistair: what was her name?
					Don't know
			Alistair mentions that the party's due to head for Cassomir in the next few days
				He'll check in prior to departure
			Dorfinn apologizes for holding this from Alistair
				He was specifically warned
				Drinking the potion will likely draw attention to Alistair
			Alistair takes his leave
				He heads back to SunnySide
					Chimpy tells him where the others are
	Back at the bar, an hour later
		Iris has gotten drunk enough to try to use her sword-hand to lift a drink
			It works
		Zaknos finally takes out Selma's journal
			He asks if it's trash
			Viola takes it before anyone does someone does something stupid with it
				Nilbog and fire
		Nilbog and Prig learned something
			There's a tunnel under the temple
			They didn't see it until clearing some debris
			Prig's been having dreams about it
			Nilbog doesn't want to go because there's probably water down there
		Viola notices a glow in her peripheral vision
			It's the flower she got from her prayer to Alseta
				It's opening in additioning to the glow
			Iris recognizes it as an item of religious connection
				Viola explains where she got it
			Tetron: what if we talk more about going into that tunnel?
				Viola expresses interest, and it does slightly open again
	Back at SunnySide
		Alistair drinks the potion
			He's seeing the following from Dorfinn's POV
				A woman has her hand on Dorfinn's forehead, she's rapidly aging
				"By the time you receive this message, this man will not remember"
				She's one of the "aureate women"
				Her mistress "swims the silver sea"
					She's pursued by the darkest of magic
				This (leaving him here) is the only way for him to have a life
				His mother will only be able to visit him in his dreams for the time being
				If he goes to the "silver sea", he can visit, but if he enters the room, he cannot leave
				His father, Peter Mueller, has been "consumed"
		Back in reality
			Alistair has no idea what the "silver sea" is
				[Luke does, though: it's almost certainly the Astral Plane]
			Alistair has this feeling of being in a dark place at night, by himself, and suddenly being aware of being watched
			Alistair's cloak moves on its own, wrapping him in a protective way
				Relic gift choice!  Shadows
				The interior of his cloak darkens, almost like a starscape
	Back at the bar, an hour later
		Tetron's gotten drunk
			He casts a spell at Iris
				She fails the will save
				It's hallucination
					He makes it so that, the next time the waitress comes around, they're hot and exactly Iris's type
						Which turns out to be slender women significantly taller than her
		The waitress comes by, asking how we're doing
			Iris knows that she's been bamboozled, but she's lookin'
		Krug notices a small group of individuals had entered
			All human
			They look wealthy
			They noticed us
			They seem to be deliberately sitting near our table
			One of them is a larger human man
				He's got a scar on his head
		Krug leans over to Viola and warns her
			She looks and doesn't recognize any of them
		The waitress notices that Iris is continuously looking at her
			Iris says she's fine
			Iris chides Tetron for doing her dirty like this
			(whispering) "I need you to be reeeeeeaaaaal"
	Back with Alistair
		Alistair asks Chimpy if he knows where the others are
			Chimpy asks him to taste-test the cheese fondue
		Alistair heads over
	Everyone at the bar
		Alistair walks in
		He notices the big man
			He matches the description Elwyn gave for the dude torturing: Rodger Macera
			One of the other people is a famous courtesan who used to work at the Velour Grotto
			Other folks are dock workers
		Tetron's trying to get Viola to tell him her type
			She hasn't been looking
			Growing up as a woman in showbiz garners unwanted attention
		Alistair pokes Viola
			Warns her
		A halfling man walks in and heads straight for Rodger's table
			They all stand and leave
			Alistair goes to follow them
	Down at Gillmen's Moor
		Luther's group boards a ship
		Alistair sees a large crane
			Next to it is a weirdly reinforced carriage
			THE BOX is starting the loading process
				Reinforced physically and magically
				Locks
				Made of metal
			There are magicians afoot, monitoring
				They look like they're ready to cast some spell in case something goes wrong
			Not much in the way of discussion here
				Just doing the job
				And the workers are clearly afraid of Luther
			They have to hitch five horses to the cart in order for it to get going
		Alistair tails the cart as it goes along
			He notices that Elwyn is here too
			The cart goes into East Hill
				Alistair doesn't risk it
	Back at the bar
		Tetron suggests that we each say something nice about Zaknos and Nilbog
			We do
		We finally leave
Bedtime
	As Viola goes to sleep, she hears the sound of a river
Sunday Morning
	Tetron wakes up to find Alistair copying from his spellbook
		Tetron's pissed
		"Your bird didn't complain!"
			Tetron checks on Taranis - looks very tired
				"Alert the others"
	Alistair tells the rest of us what he learned about THE BOX
	Alistair warns us that, after the potion, he might be being watched
To the meeting with the Maceras
	Alistair suddenly asks to be excused
		He runs to the orphanage
			He goes to Elwyn's room
				Did she learn anything else?
					Mages didn't leave the box's destination
					The box's destination was cold as shit
	Once Alistair returns, we enter East Hill
		Folks review our summons and LAP IDs
		We find ourselves in front of an oddly dark-facaded house
		We're shown to a study
			Inside are two individuals: a woman and a man
				The man is of a similar build to the one we saw yesterday
					Much less imposing
					Identical outfit, though
				The woman speaks
					Her name is Wimberly Macera
					She's giving the briefing
					She mentions us having been recommended by the Cerulean Keep
					Her eldest daughter is accompanying the box
					This job will require a deft touch
						The box is being packed as safely as it can
						It will be ready here at the Maceras' house for our departure
					Drop-off point is the Amber Trellace on the Taldan side of Cassomir
						There will be a depot for safe containment at the destination
					Payment will be half-start, half-end
					Speaking of payment, 
					If the box falls into the wrong hands, it would be bad
					This is a service that the family does for Cassomir, as a "sister city"
					Tetron: Who might be after the box?
						Most interested parties will be thrown off by it being transported by land
						Fey might be interested
						Don't need to worry about common ruffians
					Alistair: Are the spellcasters coming with us?
						The box won't need any additional magical reinforcement in-transit
						Tetron: Since spellcasters can still be charmed, could still be an issue
							Wimberly is confident in the box's built-in protection
					Her daughter, Margot, is being wed to Viscount Arando of House Vaylen
						The box is going somewhere else
						Margot is not here due to prenuptual proceedings
						Tetron: Any liabilities possible with Margot?
							Margot is well-behaved
							Might need breaks due to car sickness
							A handmaid is coming with her
								"A capable individual"
								Tetron: What if the maid is charmed?  What's her skillset?
									Physical prowess
									Also ensures that family secrets are kept
					Margot enters the room
						She has some prenup stuff for Wimberly to sign
						We're left alone with the man
							He asks if folks would like coffee
							Tetron compliments dude's coat
								It's a captain's coat, but he's not a captain
								Tetron says that we must have met the captain, then
									Yes, he mentioned that he saw adventurers
										No details
									Dude is a nervous wreck
							Tetron asks about Margot
								He's immensely proud of her
									Sad that she's leaving town
								He loves his other children
								Tetron asks if Margot has any discomforts or phobias
									Just the car sickness
									A hearty girl
								Tetron asks his opinion about her fiance
									He doesn't care for him; too loud
									"I wish I could sacrifice a second child for this"
										Oops
									Other children set to be married to smaller families
							Wimberly pokes her head in and chides her husband for talking our ear off
								Okay...
								We ask for more stuff anyway
							Iris: What's Margot's take on her fiance?
								She's fine with him
								He doesn't talk much with her of late
							Iris: What's Margot's deal, fighting wise?
								She can kick folks in the shins
								When she was a kid, she would fight (and beat) her younger brother
									He was so sure that she'd get into something martial
										But Wimberly wasn't for it
						Wimberly returns
							Anything else?  Any questions regarding "my family" here or in Cassomir?
								Nope
							1000 gp agreed?
								Yup
							Leave within a week
								Cool
								She hands us a slip
							When we leave, she asks that we leave without stopping
								Accounts should all be in order
						As we leave
							Tetron looks for a current picture of Margot
								He finds a family portrait
									Rodger is way taller than Luther
									Only Fleance is smiling
									Margot's deadpan
								Tetron asks to swap with his doppelganger real quick
									He casts illusory object inside the staff-space to replicate the portrait
							Alistair looks to see what books are on the shelves
								Lots of history, particularly regarding prominent families
								Other stuff about seafaring
The day is ours
	To the tunnel!
		We arrive at Prig's temple
			She greets us
			She asks if Nilbog told us
				He did, didn't want to go down due to water potential
				Prig explains that they found it due to heavy rain, but the area remained relatively dry, so it must be draining in there
			Before Alistair shimmies in, Tetron offers spells
				Never mind, neither levitate nor invisibility really make sense
				He goes in
		Half an hour passes, and Alistair hasn't returned
			Tetron sends Taranis in
		Meanwhile, Alistair has been shimmying for about 25 minutes
			He sees a glow
			Once he reaches the glow, he emerges into a huge cave with large blue crystals
				There are many of the same flower that Viola has
				Cavern floor is flooded, and the water is flowing
				Are the crystals valuable?
					They're kyanite, not particularly valuable, similar to quartz
				He takes a quick look for anything dangerous or noteworthy
					One particular rock moved a bit
				He heads back up
					Encounters Taranis along the way
						Taranis perches on Alistair's shoulder along the way
		Alistair reemerges
			Reports what he saw
			He wants to go back down
			Viola: How does Krug fit?
				Krug: The toddler booties
					He activates them
All the way down to the cavern
	The sound of flowing water down here matches Viola's dream from the night before
	Alistair points to the rock he saw move
	Tetron reads aura on the crystals
		Mundane
	Viola and Iris wrangle Krug and get the boots off
	Alistair climbs down to the water
		He is giving the moving rock a wide berth
		It's chest-high for him
		He heads over to the ruined structure
			It looks like it was a temple to Alseta
			There is a small and beautiful kyanite figurine that apparently depicts Alseta
				He pockets it
	Once Krug is done putting his armor back on, he and Tetron start to climb down
		Viola stops them, saying that she's always wanted to do this:
			ECHO!!!
				This disturbs the rock
					It complains about the noise
	The rock is actually part of a leshy
		It has a face drawn on it
			It looks completely done with life
		It asks what we're doing here and what year it is
			It's 4720
				It's been asleep for a few hundred years
					Oh shit, there's been a ton that's happened - Aroden's dead!
			Viola explains what we're doing here
				Enemy of my enemy is my friend
		The leshy is annoyed by the fact that the city above has grown
			It's too loud
			It already moved from the Isle of Arenway because that got too popular
		The leshy notices the ruins
			Used to be a portal, but it broke
			Viola: Where are the gatestones?
				Leshy has them, but the portal won't work because the structure is busted
					The magic leaked out
			It knows the awaken portal ritual
			Viola offers a trade: we repair the portal and give the sign to the Skyward Oak, and it gives us the sign to the Isle of Arenway
				Others aren't too interested in heading that way
				Viola notes the flower and that she doesn't know what she's supposed to do, but this seems like it's the right way
				Also, we need to stop talking about the leshy like it's not here or not a person
					Viola: What's your name
						Doesn't have one, but you can use one if that is more comfortable for you
							Dwayne
		Dwayne: You're not druids, are you
			Viola: I'm not, no
			Alistair: I am!
			Sigh...
		Dwayne notices Viola's glowing flower
			A symbol of favor
			Viola explains the prayer and that she asked for magic
				Dwayne is surprised that she doesn't already have magic
					Must need a familiar
		Viola: How do I get a familiar?
			Druids at the Isle of Arenway can help, but the leshy has seen it enough times to know the drill
				Have to gather fur, feather, and scales, plus a symbol of favor
				That'll call forth a witch's familiar
	What to use as the focus for the awaken portal ritual?
		Dwayne goes back to sleep while we do this
		Tetron: Allison Vistrum's suicide note!
			Viola BSODs, but eventually relents because it is a more eventful transition than what she was thinking
				She thought that the flower she got from a child after her first performance as Viola Ballestra would work
		Ritual starts
			SUCCESS!
				Because Tetron is good at arcana
	Dwayne wakes back up
		Alistair teaches it the sign for the Skyward Oak
		Dwayne teaches Alistair the sign for the Isle of Arenway
	Dwayne leaves for the Skyward Oak
