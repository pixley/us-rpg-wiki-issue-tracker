Fireday: Clear evening
----------------------
Oppara Art Festival theme: War and Conquest
Amos likes Eutropia
Eutropia has relaxed tariffs
Tetron worked on Eutropia's side in War for the Crown (worked with "Martella"?)
Tetron went to school in Almas following War for the Crown
Zaknos's parents split, Amos considered them a happy family beforehand
Scraggy owl is pet for Fleche
Amos invites Zaknos to breakfast at a dim sum place
Krug and Nilbog go to pray at the Sarenraen temple
- The floor is stars, the ceiling is stars
- Krug got a minor boon from Sarenrae
Tetron stays at Agrimony Point into the night
- re-locates the book he found right before sunset
Bulwark and Bolt: Sloane's business
- Alistair sneaks there Starday night
- Knocks on lightless side door
- it's a warehouse
- Sloane's office door is locked with some crazy mechanism
- He asks about containing the leaked information, Sloane requires some amount of the information; Alistair mentions potential Chelaxian messaging
- Sloane says Griv is a coward who deals in personal secrets
- Sloane says Zaugia might not end up being a problem, but she might be interested.  Zaugia probably doesn't want to work against the city
- Sloane recognizes the halfling's description; that group isn't closely affiliated with Zaugia (more trouble than they're worth).  Halfling's name is Remora.
- Says that she has work once we're LAP-certified
- Sloane knows how to find Zaugia: Points us to Dame Belcalis (free agent), she goes between districts
  - Can call on Belcalis, but it will cost
  - Would be easier to get directly to Zaugia if orc and goblin were discreet
- Knew Dorphin (Ali's old master), and recognized Alistair's affiliation
  - Has not been in contact since the heist that went bad
  - In contact with a different member
  - If Dorphin is around, he's in a jail or a gutter, by Sloane's reckoning
- Ali asks about a fence, but she won't tell until LAP certification
- Payment for Starday meeting: we do a job for her once we're LAP-certified
  - Protection mission for a specialized blacksmith, but goblin-dwarf feud might chase her out of business; deal for weapons and armor headed for Almas to go through
  - Can't let her know that she's being helped
  - It's the merchant that Viola and Krug visited
  - More info after LAP
- Sloane is also an orphan; only looked out for herself when she was young, but realized that true strength is looking out for others

Starday: Cloudy
---------------
Alistair goes to look for other adventuring parties at an inn: The Beached Narwhal
- Asks about what to expect from LAP trial
  - It's secret, but the person he talks to offers to talk about it in a roundabout way
  - Have to be stronger than common folk
  - Teamwork
  - Her party did okay
  - Dreadnaught Knight was hard, terrible large thing that's whirly and took a long time to set up; has a big shield and a big sword; deals a lot of damage
  - One last hint: the shield covers half of its body, and that has some interaction with magic
- Continues to chat afterward about adventuring, part of Heroes of the Verduran, who might be on the verge of breaking up
  - She was absent from Falcon's Hollow
  - Marcellus(?) is pissed and wants to
  - Lyca Ginte was the person he talked to (and her dad)
Viola goes to a performers' bar
- Approaches gnome is dressed in green

- Viola scheduled for the Wealday slot
  - Show is called "Viola Doesn't Know What She's Talking About"

Tetron returns to Agrimony Point
- Doesn't make much progress.
- Goes to talk to Blackstrand.
  - Discusses possibility of oracular manifestation
  - Did some research of her own
    - Might depend on whether someone from Tetron's past might have unfinished business, like some kind of ghost
    - Why would it channel through him?  Ancestor?  Tetron mentions tales his grandfather told him of some "grand wizard"
    - Try to find people who might have known that ancestor?  Probably longer-lived ancestry.
    - Find familial records?
    - How to communicate the other way?  Four generations back (great-great grandfather) makes it harder (beyond capabilities of mediums in the city)
    - Could try to find an experienced shaman, but she doesn't know of any in Almas, but is aware of one in Taldor.
      - Matriarch Tousa (or Shaman Tousa) near the Jagged Saw (coastline between Oppara and Ridonport)
        - Jagged Saw waters are generally avoided by sailors who know better.
        - Tousa is an orc
        - Some kind of treaty between Oppara and the orcs near the Jagged Saw
    - Casual orc racism
Zaknos is taken to breakfast with Amos, who has the owl with him
- Zaknos asks whether Amos has seen his mom
  - Has seen her more recently than he's seen his dad
  - Dad might have gone to Galt with Zaknos's two siblings (siblings are adults now)
  - Checked in on her: she's being well taken care of in an expensive facility
  - Zaknos admits that he doesn't know how that works

    - "someone will come to collect eventually"
- Knew his parents when they were pregnant with Zaknos
- Amos knows about the snargie thing
- Amos is kind of risk-averse
- Amos warns that security is increased between Andoran and Taldor, but he doesn't know why
  - After shipping over to Almas, he's taking a wagon from Almas to Cassomir, rather than taking a ship
  - Invites Zaknos to come along free of charge
  - "Everything is paperwork"
  - Racial profiling
Krug, Viola, Alistair head out of the city to train

- He says that he can't help
- "I never found justice for her, and I can't leave it alone."
- Daughter's name was Allison (sp?); she was enrolled at Agrimony Point
- Vistrum was up for tenure, had gotten a grant, they went to celebrate; she fell off the top of Agrimony Point the next day
- Officially ruled a suicide
- Vistrum has no proof, but he suspects that some other faculty member was involved
- "This damn paper" - suicide letter (suspected to be forged) covered in blood and magically restored
  - Writing style appears to match
  - Claims to feel immense pressure that she can't measure up to and feels like a burden
- Tetron volunteers to take the case on
- Allison had a history of picking things up quickly
- She didn't make it into the University of Almas
- She wanted to be a librarian
- Tetron borrows the suicide note and references for her normal handwriting
  - He looks it over, but can't find a discernable difference
- "Shrew" - other professor (Blackstrand) was less popular; might have had something to gain
  - Both were up for tenure, but only one slot was available
- Tetron asks about blood magic vial
  - Vistrum needs a sample of the writing, which Viola still has
Zaknos heads back to the inn
- He and the bugbear split a pitcher of beer
