Oathday, early afternoon, Aegis Coalition hideout beneath Cassomir
	Iris's feels a crunch beneath her boot
		She finds something gritty stuck to her sole with some of Cheliff's blood
	Alice emerges from the side room, Fleche carried facing away from her father and the bodies
		Fleche complains about being tired
	Iris makes it back over to Cheliff's body
		More of the grit is under her
		Iris moves to flip Cheliff over
			Something shining, golden, and teal darts out from Cheliff's person
			Time slows down
			She tries to stab it but narrowly misses
			It seems to be heading toward Tetron, which passes Alistair
				Alistair clasps his hands around it
					He calls out for a container to put it in
						We all approach
						The time dilation is hitting Alice and especially Fleche worse
						Iris has a moment to think: she remembers a fairy that was imprisoned in Cheliff's office
							Alistair has apparently caught an elder fey
								Which have major influence over certain domains
								This one has domain over time, specifically the present
								But they come in threes, and the past and future ones must be nearby
									Iris isn't sure whether it's doing this because it feels threatened
			Tetron can just make out the fey's voice, speaking Fey
				He catches the end of a manic sentence: "The center of all time!  I must go!"
				Tetron pulls out his waterskin and Alistair shoves it in
					Time returns to normal
	Tetron pokes a hole in his waterskin and starts to talk to the fey
		It complains about the indignity suffered by an elder fey
		Tetron apologizes for the mistaken identity
			It is slightly offended by being considered mundane
			It asks to be let out to talk
				Tetron doesn't buy it
	Meanwhile, Alistair goes to check the other door
		No traps
		He opens it
		For a brief moment, there's a meeting room with a pulpit inside
		The room gets entirely spatially fucked and gravity dies
INITIATIVE
	Round 1
		Alistair looks around for an opponent but finds nothing, closes the door, then floats over to the rest of the group
		The room's space shifts around the main cluster, but only Iris is caught up in it as she's thrown through a wall that apparently no longer has collision
		Alice screams out to hold on to something as she is thrown upward, but she manages to catch a chair while also holding Fleche
		Tetron asks the fey what the hell is going on, tries to analyze the situation but he can't make heads or tails of it, then just tries to brace himself
			She just says that's just how some things work in the First World
			Tetron asks for clarification, but she just says that time and space just go woo-woo-woo
		Viola enters her dueling dance, looks around for an opponent but only determines that the furniture is poised to charge us, then launches through the door that Alistair closed only to find that the room is now empty
		Iris analyzes the room, looks for what could be the bound object, then launches toward the lectern and attacks it (miss)
			It's a creature
			The way to nullify it is to disable the object it has attached itself to
			This kind of creature usually attach themselves to places where powerful creatures have perished
			She can see papers with our names on them in addition to the furniture
			She rises to be eye-level with the book on the lectern and sees that it's open to the Song of the Sellen
		Krug gets shifted and knocks into Sloane, Alistair, and Tetron, attacks the floor thrice
		End of round: We hear a sound that assaults our ego
			Except Iris
			Alistair gets really fucked up
	Round 2
		Alistair launches up to the book and stabs (miss)
		The room's space shifts again, sending Krug and Tetron flying
			Tetron slams into Viola
			Krug is shifted in the opposite direction
		Alice clings to her chair for dear life and grabs one of the papers, discovering that it's addressed to Alistair
		Tetron considers the situation further, then casts lightning bolt at the lectern (fail)
			We are in the grips of something similar to a spellbound ruin, but those usually attach to ancient places where powerful entities died
			He shares this with the rest of us
				Iris shouts back that she's well aware
			After casting lightning bolt, he hears part of a song in his head: "Those who deign to cut the thread sent drifting once again"
		Viola launches up and stabs (hit, miss)
			On hit, she hears the same song line that Tetron did
		Iris starts reading the Song aloud, tries to find the paper addressed to her, then wildly misses a stab at the lectern
			Spare a thought for the weaver's hands
			Whose loom lays bare the fates of men:
			Those who deign to cut the thread
			Sent drifting once again
		Krug looks for other books and finds none, then launches up to the lectern and charges at it (miss)
		End of round: Ego assault again on all except Tetron
			Krug glimpses for Alistair
			Iris still holds it together
	Round 3
		Alistair activates his bracelet of dashing, flies over to Alice, takes the paper from her, and gives it a quick scan
			Two individuals are seeking him in Cassomir and four in Oppara
		The room's space shifts again in an attempt to clear folks of the lectern
			Krug is pushed out of the room entirely, making him feel entirely unwell
		Alice pushes off her chair towards a distant piece of paper
		Tetron tries to determine whether attacking arbitrary parts of the room will hurt, then casts Howling Blizzard up at the furniture
			Attacking the floor only deals half damage
			The space around the room starts to collapse
				Krug can see other planes and realizes that staying out here will hurt
		Viola snatches the book off the lectern and sings the remaining two lines, then closes the book
			Spare a thought for the silhouette
			Once trusted friend with whom you fought,
			An endless water pouring down
			On the star the sky forgot.
Back to normal
	Tetron asks for the book
		Viola: Hold on a sec
	The fey complains further as a quip in response to Viola, in Common
		We negotiate her release
			Tetron's mouth gets sealed, though
		Her name is Cyanthia
		Cheliff imprisoned her
		Iris informs her that she killed Cheliff
			Cyanthia greatly appreciates this
		She needs a "thread of time" (which she had in the First World, but it's missing now), "melody on the wind", "melodic squall", "cloak of the fabric of space-time"
		Iris asks whether anything on the back wall would help
			One of the three, the weaver (norn), would help
		In any case, she'd need to fight that creature's remains and would need to defend Amos from its cohorts
		Iris: Why capture you if the weaver was used instead?
			Cheliff had other plans in Oppara
		Iris: When were you captured?
			About a month ago
	Meanwhile, Alistair shakes Sloane awake
		He signs at her to ask what the book was
			He adds that he'll do what he can to keep her safe if she helps
			She mouths: important book, personal information, scraped from powerful entity, extremely dangerous
		Next sign: How to free Amos?
			She nods towards the items on the back wall - those creatures' fates are intertwined with Amos's
				Must unsew what has been sewn and prepare to fight
			How to unsew?  Did you have a plan?
				She doesn't know how to unsew.  They had no intention of letting Amos out.
		What purpose does this Amos situation serve?
			Jericho is conducting a mortal experiment
		How involved was Cheliff?
			More than Sloane
	The fey notices that Sloane is awake
		Viola: WTF?
		Alistair: Getting info
			She corroborated the fey's explanation on how to free Amos
		Sloane tilts her head so that her face is obscured by her hair and mouths "if you are truly my ally, kill me"
			Why?
			"It's the only mercy I ask for."
			Does it have to be now?
		Krug starts trying to sway Sloane
			Alistair jumps in with the patriotic angle
				She could help Andoran against Cheliax as long as 
	Iris turns her attention back to the fey
		She gives Tetron his mouth back
			He doesn't say anything
		How can we make the fight easier for you?
			Gather her sisters
				One held by some kind of draconic creature
					SON OF A BITCH
				The other escaped
				Do you want to come with?
					Sure, but being in close proximity to more than one of them will be discomforting for mortals
					Iris suggests she use her time powers to negate the guards
						Alistair suggests that he just sneak in
							Tetron: wasn't it heavy?
								Fey: Oh, heavy means future
				Past is most powerful
					Iris expresses her disgust for the past
						Sianthia (corrected spelling): Would you like to have her erase it?
							...Maybe not
					Oh, the observatory reported a temporal disturbance
		Viola makes the pact: free her sisters, and she and her sisters will do their part to free Amos
		How to summon: take the daisy and say "Siantha, I come to make good on my pact"
	Back to Sloane
		Iris marches over and introduces herself
		Alistair messages Viola to ask whether we could sway Sloane by telling her that we have the Shield of Aroden
			Ask Tetron
			No
		Iris connects with Sloane over hatred for Cheliax
			Sloane puts some of the pieces together and Iris helps her the rest of the way
		Who's the halfling
			Dannin [missed last name]
			Fleshwarp combination between a halfling and a shining child
				We don't know what a shining child is
				Sloane explains: creatures who seek knowledge
			Don't know why he hung out with the Coalition
