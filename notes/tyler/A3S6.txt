Starday afternoon in Timberfell
	Viola "good day"s Sirran and walks away
		He doesn't accept that
		Tetron tells him that she meant "great day"
	We keep walking
		Alistair explains what the other guard told him
		He leads us to Portia's place
		Some folks loitering outside
		Orc asks what we want
			Viola explains that we're here to see Portia
			She adds that "the gnome" doesn't like us
				That helps
		Portia lets us in
			She's a ginger human
			She tells us that she doesn't have anything that she hadn't already told the guards
				That's fine, Tahseen won't tell us anyway
			Viola asks her to start at the beginning
				Portia and her group were patrolling their 9-midnight route
				Heard a disturbance, but no scream
					Almost like the sound of sewage
				Went over and found a collapsed coffinmaker
					Initially looked like he had passed out
					They flipped him over to find that his entire front side was melted
						This is the same method as some of the other victims
							Others were torn apart
						Only the side that hits the ground is affected
			Alistair asks how long ago it was
				Two weeks ago
				Dude's been buried
					One of the more recent victims could still be on-hand
				All murders have been at night
					Also concentrated in the lower half of Timberfell
					Caused popular theory: creatures of the night
						Viola picks up on Portia's firm rejection of the theory
							Portia insists that it would be ridiculous
							Viola informs her that we just fought undead Leslie
								Portia isn't convinced
			Tetron considers what kind of creature it could be
				Probably not something that would have come from a splash weapon or a military-used creature
				Could perhaps have come from a weapon?
			There are sewers around
				Alistair considers the area
			Viola confirms that the melting and tearing are the only methods of death
				Seems like the victim melts into the earth
					Difficult to remove
			Tetron asks whether there's visual documentation
				They do have docs
				She shows us a map of the deaths
					The attacks have happened north-to-south
			Alistair notices that the most runoff from rain happens in southern Timberfell
				Alistair asks whether the culprit being from the river has been considered
					Tahseen has flat-out ignored the possibility
						He's focused more on the vampire/creature angle
							The not having crossed water thing could be a thing
								Viola is aware that they don't like water
			We resolve to go check out the scene of the latest murder
				Portia says that she's coming with us
	Scene of latest murder - tip of the peninsula
		On the way, we pass the HQ
		The scene appears to be an animal stockyard
		The ground is sludgy
		Portia leans against the gate and points at the middle of the enclosure
			They didn't find the victim until the next morning
			They didn't see any tracks, but it had rained the night prior
				This was four days ago, and it hasn't rained since
				Tetron asks if Zaknos could find tracks
					Zaknos talks himself up, saying that they always leave tracks, but he doesn't find jack shit
		Tetron asks whether the body had been moved
			No drag marks or anything
			Teleported or dropped from above?
				Eh.
		Alistair asks whether anything connected the victims
			Portia says no
		Zaknos goes into the hay piles to investigate
			Nothing of interest
		Alistair volunteers to go check the river to see if there's any evidence in there
			Tetron says he can swap a slot for water breathing
			He does
		Tetron asks Portia where the nearest sewer entrance is
			She points him there
		Alistair gets into the water with Viola serving as life guard
			Scanning near the shore
				Wood debris
				Trash
				Nothing out of the ordinary
		Could we check the other sites?
			It's rained enough times that if we couldn't find tracks here, we almost certainly wouldn't be able to find anything
		Portia comes over to ask if we've found anything
			Nope
			Could we see the body of the most recent victim?
				Sure
		Other victims' jobs?
			Young worker folk
			Three humans, one half-orc
	To the body
		At a Consortium morgue
		It's pretty melty
			Bones are intact
		Tetron checks for magic
			No magic
			But as he inspects the body closely, he notices that the melty part does follow where the ground
				The soles of the feet are completely melted, so he could have stepped in it first
					But they always fall forward...
		Does anyone use magic?
			There's "light magic security", according to Portia
			She doesn't know whether any higher-ups do magic
	To one of the other scenes
		Nothing doing
	We think about how to get into the sewers
		Portia gets us access to a map of maintenance access points
		Viola considers whether the sewers run directly under the attack sites
			How to tell?
				The Pellsieve!
Into the sewers!
	Bottom is 40 feet down
	Viola writes a note next to the manhole to let people know to leave the cover open
	Super branchy system
	Follow the Pellsieve
	Sound of running water grows louder until we find a broken pipe with river water gushing out of it
		It's at the end of the tunnel
	Perhaps there are broken pipes at the other sites
	Alistair looks for tracks
		No tracks, but he does see impact and corrosion evidence right next to the breakage
			It looks like it's been used to go in and out multiple times
			No evidence of similar damage happening on the ceiling
	Is there anything alive?
		Uh...  Yes.
		There's a face under the sewage
			Just the skin part of the face
			Zaknos reaches for it
				Something grabs him and pulls him waist-first into the sewage
					It's an eye goo monster
INITIATIVE
	Round 1
		Nilbog casts forbidding ward on Zaknos and the eye goo monster, then casts shield
		Zaknos goes for the eye goo monster's eyes, taking acid damage in the process, then marks it as his prey, then escapes
		Alistair jumps across to flank the goo monster and draws his sword
		Viola jumps to join Alistair's flank, feints against it, then gets a mediocre crit on it
		The eye goo monster stands up from the water, then slams down towards Viola and Alistair, the latter of whom dodges out of the way of the acidic splash, then slips back into the water
		Tetron hastes Krug, then gives the monster the scariest glare
		Krug steps into the water, crits twice, then raises his shield
	Round 2
		Nilbog heals Viola and Zaknos
		Zaknos quick draws both his swords, missing both times due to concealment, then misses a double slash
		Alistair shanks three times: hit, crit, crit
		Viola feints, misses a normal strike, then hits a finisher
		The eye goo monster stands back up, then swipes at Nilbog and Krug, who both fail to get out of the way (but Krug Glimpses the damage against Nilbog), then moves past Viola and Alistair
		Tetron hastes Alistair, then moves to cast more light on the situation
		Krug moves into the sewage, crits twice, then gives the monster the scariest glare
	Round 3
		Nilbog casts fire ray and hits (it resists fire a bit), then casts shield
		Zaknos moves up to the monster, double slashes (hit and crit), then misses a last attack
		Alistair shanks three times: hit, hit, miss, crit; crit kills it
After combat
	The eyes dissolve into foam, and the goo washes away, leaving behind some kind of tag or card
		The card has employment info
		It's in Old Taldan
		It's for someone who worked as a Taldan guard
		It's old and water damaged
		Ianus Mallea is the name
		Dated to back before Cheliax existed
		Not magic
	The manhole has been left open, but someone scuffed the note
	Portia is there
		We tell her what happened
		Since the monster dissolved, we don't really have proof of it dying
		Portia says that next time it rains, if no one dies, then we get paid
		We mention the broken pipe
			There might be others near the other attack sites
		Tahseen approaches and yells at us for going into the sewer
			He claims he found the killer: a vampire
			We tell him about the monster, but he doesn't care
			He insists that he's right
		Portia says that it'll be difficult to prove that she's not a vampire, because she is one
			She pulls us aside to explain that the Consortium hired the vampire to investigate the first attack
			But this is private info
			They pinged Beltracci to get her services 
		Tetron starts reallocating spells
			He decides to head toward the Keep to check whether the vampire has been grabbed
		Zaknos buys some corn on the cob
	Viola runs off towards the vampire's house
		Alistair follows
		We see him at the far end of the bridge telling a guard to look out for the vampire
		We meet a young adult half-orc on the spectrum
			He's the vampire's brother
			She isn't home
			He didn't even know about the murders
			He knows about Beltracci, and she's probably at his hideout
			Viola tells him to warn his sister to keep the fuck away from the cops if he sees her
			We duck out before Tahseen shows up
		We decide to meet back up with the others and head to the university
	At the University
		We ask around for directions to creature studies
		We need Tetron to let us into the library
			Taranis shows up
				This is where 
				Viola explains the situation
				He flies back to Tetron
					Taranis keeps a lookout to see if Tahseen comes by the Keep
		Tetron shows up
			He lets us in, but he can only bring two guests - he chooses Viola and Alistair
			We look for books on oozes (Tetron), eye monsters (Viola), and just anything that seems relevant (Alistair)
				Tetron does find a bunch of books on oozes and acidic stuff
					Info overload, unfortunately
					Can't find anything
				Viola is just completely overwhelmed
				Alistair finds a book on religion that mentions entries related to people who have part of their mortal being still on the material plane
		Meanwhile, outside with Krug, Zaknos, and Nilbog
			Zaknos is still eating his corn on the cob
			Krug suggests that they should try to be helpful still
				Zaknos says that they're doing all they can do
			Various students and faculty pass by
		Back in the library
			Tetron decides to look into the history of the troop of which the guy on the card was a part
				They were common land-based guards
				They were stationed around various cities in Taldor's prime
					Probable that the guy was stationed in Almas before it was even called that
				Alistair suggests that there may be some kind of magic that could read into an object's past
					Tetron considers this and recalls the existence of the occult spell object reading
					We'd need a bard or something
					With that spell, we'd be able to prove that the goo monster did the murders
					Tetron says that we should take this to Tahseen's boss
	To the Keep
		A no-nonsense catfolk woman is Tahseen's boss
			We explain what happened with the goo monster and that Tahseen is looking to seize an innocent person
			She takes the card and says that they'll start looking into it
			They won't need to contact us, since payment is through the Consortium guard
