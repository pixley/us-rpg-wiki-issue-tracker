## Labels

Issues are labelled with their status and the type of page they reference.  Here is a brief guide:

### Status

#### To Do

Issue has not been started yet.  Generally unassigned.

#### In Progress

When someone begins work on an issue, its status is updated to "in progress".  If you begin work, assign the issue to yourself.

#### Ready to Review

Once you're done with the issue's work, flag it as "ready to review" so that Tyler or others can double-check your work for accuracy, syntax, and style.

#### Blocked

Some other issue needs to be completed before further work can proceed on this one.

### Type

#### Quest

Quest log pages are divided into a handful of categories: main, side, and personal.

Main quests follow the primary overarching goals of the party, such as their efforts to stop the Aegis Coalition.

Side quests are other activities undertaken by the party.  These are further divided by the location in which they take place.

Personal quests represent the individual goals and growth of party members.  These are further divided by the party member to whom the quest belongs.

#### Item

Certain key items or in-universe documentation warrant pages.

#### Profile

NPCs, enemies, factions, locations, and even party members have profile pages.  These follow templates to communicate basic information before getting into specific knowledge.

#### Calendar

Every session, the current date on the calendare needs to be updated, and any dates covered by that session need to marked for that session.  Additionally, certain major events are also placed on the calendar, such as holidays, birthdays, and major story beats.  A calendar issue should be made for each session played.

#### Media

Some visual media, usually images, need to be uploaded.  This is typically Luyou's responsibility, as she is the one who makes portraits, in-universe documents, etc.

#### Session Summary

Each session is given a paragraph summary on the Session Summary page.  A summary issue should be made for each session played.

#### Raw Notes

For publicly-shared notes, each session's notes need to be uploaded.

### Closed

For issues closed for reasons other than completion, there are tags to indicate what happened.

#### Duplicate

The work described by the issue is already represented by a pre-existing issue.

#### Wontfix

The work described by the issue has been deemed irrelevant to the wiki.

## Issue closure

Once an issue is deemed complete, its status tag is removed.
